return "New Class: #LIGHT_GREEN#Corruptor (Demonologist)",
[[Demons in their invasion of Eyal have abducted natives of the planet and mindwiped them to serve as double agents.
Trained in the use of the demon's own forces they have created many dark cults to spread fear and terror.
Some have managed to escape their programming and chose to follow their own desires instead.

You have been defeated countless demons, seen how their essence work, witnessed how to bind demons to your own purpose and can now create new characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Demonologist class#WHITE#.

Corruptors are spellcasters, ranged attackers using magic.
Class features:#YELLOW#
- Infect your foes with demonic seeds.
- Bind demonic seeds to your equipment to enhance them.
- Summon and control demons to do your binding.
- Blend corrupted magic with a martial shield training to protect yourself and ruin your foes.#WHITE#

Corruptors use "vim" to power their special abilities.
Vim is the life force of all beings. It does not regenerate, and can only be stolen from your foes.
