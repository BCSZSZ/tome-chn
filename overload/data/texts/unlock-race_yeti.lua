return "New Race: #LIGHT_GREEN#Yeti",
[[
Yetis are native creatures to the cold mountains of the Clork peninsula, highly evolved bipedal animals they still lack true sentience.
Their white fur covers an extremely strong body, but their minds are weak.
Techno-psionics of the Kruk Pride have managed to devise a system to hijack a yeti's body, transferring their own mind into them to increase the Pride's fighting power.

You have helped capture multiple Yetis for such purpose and can now create a new character with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Yeti race#WHITE#.

Race features:#YELLOW#
- Algid Rage, call upon the harsh climate of their birthplace to freeze their foes
- Mindwave, the controlling orc retains a small part of his psionic powers, giving them a powerful mind-tool
- Strong body#WHITE#
