title = "欢迎来到马基埃亚尔 - #CRIMSON#乌鲁克之灰烬"

return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.
You do not remember much of your life before you were on this burning continent, floating in the void between worlds.  You have been helping demons, happily participating in their experiments to shatter some sort of shield preventing them from taking their righteous revenge on Eyal.

You are being taken by your handler to the torture-pits to help them figure out how to cause the most pain to those on Eyal, when you hear a roaring above you; you look up and see a burning meteor, flying closer, and the demons' spells failing to divert its course!  It lands near you, knocking you off your feet with its shockwave and killing your handler instantly.

As you recover, and your platform of searing earth splits from the main continent, your old memories flood your mind and you come to your senses - the demons are out to destroy your home!

#{bold}#You must escape!#{normal}#.
