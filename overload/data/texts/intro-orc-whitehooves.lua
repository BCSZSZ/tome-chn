return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.
You were a member of the shunned and hunted minotaur race. Your tribe found a way to survive through necromancy.

The only race to ever show respect, if not kindness, to yours was the Orcs and now you found your tribe under the control of a mad leader.
If you help the Orcs with their problems you hope they will with yours; for the sake of both your kinds.

You have been sent to the Vaporous Emporium to wreak havoc and demoralize the giants.
For the Krimbul Clan !
