return "New Talent Category: #LIGHT_GREEN#Undead Drake",
[[Drakes are forces of Nature, the ultimate apex predators. But as they grow old some gain sentience and some of those may wish to prolong their lives beyond death.
You have encountered one such and vanquished it.

You can now master Undead Drake magic and create new Wyrmic characters that can learn the #LIGHT_GREEN#Undead Drake talents#WHITE#.

Talents:
- #YELLOW#Raze: #WHITE#Augment your melee strikes with deadly energies, absorbing the souls of your foes
- #YELLOW#Infectious Miasma: #WHITE#Release a deadly cloud of diseases and blight
- #YELLOW#Vampiric Surge: #WHITE#Revel in the pain of others to heal yourself
- #YELLOW#Necrotic Breath: #WHITE#Breath pure darkness
]]
