#{bold}#第一章：决定命运的会面#{normal}#

    这个故事始于厄流纪，那时我还是个年轻的精灵小伙子，在我们永恒精灵之中，少年、青年与老年仍旧是个沉重的话题。这只是在那个年代诸多英勇传奇、神话传说中的一个故事，我能讲述的，也只是我自己的故事，我自身的经历，所谓的英雄事迹，讲述一次震动世界、改变历史的变化——魔法大爆炸——和我自己之间一点微末的联系。

    第一次遇见莱娜尼尔时，我们正准备举行一场特殊的会议，我们的领袖伊菲尼亚斯与卡库罗尔的首领谈话。我还记得那个体型庞大的人类男子是怎样昂首迈入我们的城门，包括我在内的大群精灵被他宽厚的胸膛，怒立的头发，美丽的毛皮衣物和坚定不屈的脚步所吸引震慑。在我们瘦弱渺小的精灵肉体面前，他仿佛是异世来的怪物……

    有些同伴把他视为野人，但我从他冰霜般的眼睛里看到了强大的力量。他来自于人类种族中勇敢坚强的一支，那是曾居住于埃亚尔北方的一群人，据说他们是从北方那永冬的天空里闪烁的绿色火焰里汲取了力量。他的名字是特塞尔，他的相貌并没有被北方肆虐数个世纪的暴风雪摧残，他的右手带着卡库罗尔之戒，光彩耀人的黄金戒指上镶嵌着闪亮的红宝石，这是他的地位象征——他领导着全马基埃亚尔大陆最伟大的人类法师联盟。

    走在他身后的，是和他一起来的一对双胞胎，他的女儿们，莱娜尼尔与尼耶拉。她们的相貌别无二致，但我立刻发现她们的性格迥然不同。她们的发色同样深红，蓄着同样的长发，在阳光下露出同样苍白的皮肤。尽管同样身着丝绸长袍，尼耶拉的长袍是橙色与金黄，莱娜尼尔却是深蓝与银白。尼耶拉性格开朗，声音愉快，讨论着一路上走过埃尔瓦拉庭院时见到的美好事物。而莱娜尼尔安静文雅，面色严肃，冷静地分析计算她见到的一切。不过，在她那冷若寒霜的外表下，我能看到一团火焰——不，不仅仅是火，那是一团正在燃烧的火光，一团散发光和热的激情，正被压抑着，等待着释放。当人群到达我们的大本营时，有那么一会儿，我们彼此眼神相触，短短的一瞬间，我看到了她野性的灵魂和激烈的思绪，那是不可征服的坚定意志与精神力量。那一刻，我停止了呼吸。

    几乎没有精灵能理解，为什么精灵种族中的一员，会对一个人类深深的着迷。那只是因为他们不了解莱娜尼尔。我也从来没了解过莱娜尼尔。她就像一团活着的火焰，一团燃烧的情感和欲望。她热诚的精神不能被任何人否认，她的智慧言谈吸引了众人围绕。美貌、闪光，象夏日般耀眼，同时也会变得冰冷遥远、不可触碰，除非她意愿如此。长久的岁月以来，这一点，她一直保持不变。

    我几乎错过尼耶拉走过大门时对我的热情问候。莱娜尼尔只对我点了点头。我们的领袖和客人们走入了主会所入座，我也紧跟了进去。这次会议是对一项新计划的讨论——我们最伟大的法师们将从夏·图尔传送门中提取能量。长久以来，那个古老种族的遗迹被埋藏在土壤之下，连同它们的力量一起，不见天日。一旦这股强大的力量被我们发掘利用，我们将能够迅速结束同兽人的战争。他们称这个大计划为“魔法大爆炸”——一个我们至今仍旧敬畏着的名字。

    我们的国王伊菲尼亚斯主持了会议，介绍了来客和周围的精灵们。“这是我的将军”，他指向我，“永恒精灵军队指挥官加威尔。“莱娜尼尔马上望了过来，然后呆立当场。

    ”什么？！“她惊叫道，盯着我的护甲和配饰。然后她转过去别开我们，似乎不愿关注。”父亲，我们来这里究竟为了什么？“她对那个结实的男子说道，”你告诉我们，永恒精灵们拥有最强大的元素法师，但他们的将军居然躲在钢铁后面，被铁剑环绕。难道一个近身格斗的战士也能掌握这门艺术？“

    伊菲尼亚斯看起来很生气，不过我突然大笑起来，既是因为她极度冒犯的话语，也因为她那大胆的推测与隐藏的傲慢。“一个贴身战士？”我在喘气的同时勉强说道，“女士，你不应该用外表评价他人。因为，如果由我来说，我还从没见过如此失礼的姑娘，同时还是操纵火焰的大师，并拥有比她冷血的父亲更加坚定的意志。但不要以为你在这门技艺上就能胜过我！因为我是艾伦尼恩·加威尔，奥术之刃的大师，能操纵各种强大的元素之力。充盈在我的金属利器里的法术收割的兽人生命比你在短短的生命中见过的兽人还要多，甚至比你一生见过的兽人更多。”

    她望着我，突然来了兴趣。“听上去是一种很奇怪的技巧。在我们能轻易从远处烧伤敌人的情况下，这样做似乎很滑稽。尽管如此。当我们一起狩猎兽人的时候，我会亲自见识一下。但你可得证明给我看，证明你在战场上比我强。”

    “我将尽我所能来向你证明，女士。”我点头答道。她的嘴唇上露出微微的笑意。

    特塞尔咕噜了两句，然后将他毛发茂密的脑袋转向国王。“说正事。”他生硬而简要地阐述自己的要求，正如之前我所听闻的一样。

    伊菲尼亚斯清了清喉咙，一屁股坐回板凳上。“在我们面前有一项伟大的计划，”他尽可能用一种激昂的语调说话，“多年以来，我们一直疲于应付兽人的进犯。自从厄流之战以来，我们的力量始终虚弱。逆转困境的机会就在眼前了，马上我们的敌人就会得到彻底的休息了。他们一直威胁着我们，要击溃我们的军队，摧毁我们的城市。我们损失的已经太多了。特塞尔，我对你个人的巨大损失表示深深的同情。”兽皮披身的男人脸色未动，但我清清楚楚地看到，他的两个女儿沉默着低下了头。

    “我一直在领导着我们的法师团体，探索夏·图尔传送门的秘密。我们相信，我们有能力激发其内部封印着的强大力量，来制造一股毁灭性的冲击波，直指向兽人大军。如果各个种族能联合起来，吸引住兽人的注意力，我们将会以一次快速的打击终结这场旷日已久的战争。兽人将会被彻底打垮，再无重来之日，而我们赖以生息的埃亚尔大陆也将得到净化。”

    “我已经同其他种族的首领接触过了，半身人非常支持这项计划，拿加尔摄政王甚至同意将他们历史上对夏·图尔遗迹的部分研究成果同我们分享。”

    特塞尔突然狠狠地诅咒起来：“那些以人类奴隶为素材的研究！”他不禁大声咆哮，然后沉默了一会，尽可能平复心情，“你们生活在海中和森林里的同类呢？”

    伊菲尼亚斯直视着他的眼睛，“纳鲁精灵们太骄傲了，不愿参与我们的合作。他们认为只凭自己就足以保护城池和土地。虽然我认为他们最终还是会感谢我们……自然精灵也不是很感兴趣。我同他们的国王和皇后讨论过，并保证我们的选择是绝对安全的，不过他们并不很相信我们和奥术力量，但他们也不反对。夏特尔同我们一样，被边境线上兽人的进攻弄得精疲力竭。他们会帮助我们的，尽管我们并不是很需要这帮助，但接受一切帮助总是有好处的。”

    “其他的人类首领大部分都赞同这项计划，也有人表现出不可理喻的恐惧。当然，各种神话传说仍然是阻止我们探索夏·图尔的原因之一。不过，我们现在清醒地认识到我们在做的事情。我相信卡库罗尔的精英们一定能理解，同时你们的加入比一群小国王的支持更为重要。”

    这个结实的男子盯着伊菲尼亚斯的眼睛看了好一会儿，随后转过去看着他的女儿们，“女孩们，你们怎么看？”

    尼耶拉首先回答了问话，脸上闪耀着光彩，声音饱含着情感。“我认为永恒精灵的国王十分自负，和我们关系疏远。尽管他试图表现同情，却利用我们对母亲的感情。而且，就算他说的再好，我们又怎么能相信真能解开夏·图尔遗迹里的秘密呢？要知道，这秘密流传千年无人能解，隐藏的力量毫无头绪。到底是什么让父亲你认为我们能合作呢？大胆挥舞一把不知用法的未知武器，难道不是一桩危险而荒唐的行为吗？”

    房间里的空气顿时变得一片寂静，我几乎能看到我们的国王陛下——伊菲尼亚斯正气得冒烟，显然他从未听过也不能习惯如此激烈直接的批评反对。莱娜尼尔这时开口了，尽管语调低沉清冷，所有人都竖起耳朵听着，“在那个辉煌年代诞生的伟大杰作已经沉眠上千年。我们如今的精妙艺术、宏伟城市、美好社会从何而来？我不能给出答案，但我知道，这些和那沉睡已久的艺术品毫无瓜葛。我相信，对伟大的模仿不应该、也不可能让人感觉耻辱。但是我们长久以来错误的谦逊铸就了真正的错误。太久了，夏·图尔遗留的强大力量已经埋藏太久，那些早已被恐惧和胆怯填满的内心将它们拒之门外。”我仿佛看到她的眼睛里闪烁着激动的光。“想想我们将要解开的奇迹！结束对兽人的战争只是一个开始，我们将会从中受益良多。我要说，要是我们将这股力量再度深藏地下，等待不知多少年后的人来小心翼翼地重头发掘，将是埃亚尔大陆上最大的罪行。”

    特塞尔停了一会儿，慢慢地点头，显然莱娜尼尔的想法和他更为接近。“非常好，”他慢慢地宣布，同时再度直视伊菲尼亚斯。“我们会加入你们。”尼耶拉沉默了，表现出深深的担忧，而她的妹妹莱娜尼尔显露了一丝满意的神色。]],

#{bold}#第二章：难忘之夜#{normal}#

    三天后的午夜，我在一场噩梦中惊醒。眼前窗户大开，晦暗的光线中丝织的帘幕在晚风中舞动。随着我的眼睛渐渐适应了夜晚微弱的亮光，视线中隐约看到清朗的晚风中，莱娜尼尔身穿轻柔的紧身蔚蓝长裙的身影。她的腰间环绕着镶嵌着蛋白石和苍色符文的羊绒腰带，颈上腕间环绕着闪耀的金制首饰，一根顶端镶着一颗闪耀的红宝石的长杖静静地躺在她的手中。清风吹拂，她澄澈的眸子中映出我的影子，红色的长发迎风飘荡。
 
    “你在做什么呢？”，我轻轻问道。我并没有打算询问她到底是如何绕过那些卫兵悄悄潜入我的卧房的，议会的成员或许也没有能力在她集中精力潜行的时候感知他的存在。
 
    她明媚的目光轻柔地凝视着我，接着在屋子的四周扫过，仔细分析着房间里的每一个部分。“有一队兽人劫掠正从北方赶来”，她稍有些心烦意乱地说道，手中漫不经心把玩着我在书架上放着的一把装饰用的匕首，“他们看起来似乎准备对一些边远的精灵营地发动进攻。”
 
    “我立刻就召集突击队迎敌。”，我不顾礼仪地从床上坐起。
 
    “唔，那样多无聊啊”，嘟哝着的她将匕首轻轻放下，回身面向着我，“你还记得我们曾经约定一起去狩猎兽人吗？”
 
    “……什么？就只有我们两个人去吗？”
 
    “唉呀”，她缓缓望向我裸露在外的肌肉，眼中好奇的神情如同小孩子一样欢欣，“你是个男人吗？”
 
    “对于精灵族来说这还真是个怪问题，我的女士。不过，我可以在此保证，只需要我一个人也可以亲手干掉那些兽人。如果你真的想要一同前行的话，我可能没法确保您的安全。”
 
    她的笑声如同水晶泠泠碰撞般清脆。“那真是太好了！来，拿上你的金属棍子，让我们来比一比谁才是这个领域的专家。”我微笑着点头，打开房间里的武器库，从中拿出了金属护胫，锁子甲，胸甲和钢臂铠。莱娜尼尔有些焦急的埋怨道，“你非得穿上这堆废铜烂铁不可吗？”
 
    “这是我的战斗服”，我戴上头盔，披上斗篷。
 
    “唔，看起来简直就像一只炼金傀儡，”她小声咕哝着，“快来吧，我有点无聊了。”紧接着，她轻巧地越过窗台，优雅地随风而去，在夜空中划出一道弧线。
 
    我拿起了我的爱剑。乍一眼看上去，这似乎只是一把普通的剑刃，唯一的装饰是剑柄上一颗硕大的月亮石。这把剑由矮人于多年之前所铸，其貌不扬却强韧无比。之后，他们的虚荣和浮华替代了匠人的坚毅，让装备成为了用于炫耀的道具而不是用于战斗的兵器。这把剑的剑锋可以轻易穿透钢铁和骨头，如同划破薄纸一般势如破竹。它的名字叫做斩月剑，尽管现在已经随着岁月的流逝而不知所踪。我轻轻将其掷向空中，在空中形成一道气流的屏障，紧接着向外跃去跳到其之上，跟随着莱娜尼尔在夜空中飞行。
 
    在错杂的云间，我们沉默不语，直到二十分钟紧张的步伐后莱娜尼尔的身躯开始下降。群山间点缀着营地的篝火，随着高度的下降，兽人的战歌之声渐渐传来。“我们应该怎么发起进攻？”，寒风中我喊了出来，想看看这位女魔法师准备采取什么样的策略。
 
    “正面上”，随着一声咒语的轻响，她的身躯如箭般风驰电掣，径直向兽人营地冲去，踏足在营地的正中央。我紧随着她念动咒语跟上他的速度并在她的身旁降落，望着身旁愤怒的兽人发出警报，拿起武器，手中的斩月剑反射着月亮的光华。随着月下兽人们的刀斧剑戟黑色的影子将我们团团围绕，莱娜尼尔转过头来，嘴角露出一丝微笑。

    “舞会开始了”
 
    一道紫色的奥术能量从她的右手指尖射出，而她左手高举法杖，杖端如同火炬般被炽焰所缠绕。随着剑尖高举，一团团火焰从我的剑刃上腾跃而起，在我面前呈弧形喷发出来，迅速击倒了最前排的兽人，爆裂的冲击波向他身后的部队席卷而去。我紧逼而前，炽热之风在四周环绕咆哮。兽人军队在灼热的刺激下只能丢下慌忙武器试图抵挡呛人的烟雾，直到我怀着满意的微笑冲上前去，一剑终结他们的性命。突然，一团火焰冲击将我击倒。转身望去，只见莱娜尼尔站在熊熊烈火之中，双臂向前伸展，烈焰应之而动。“对你来说是不是有些太热了呢，艾伦尼恩先生？”。在她的谈笑之间，周围的兽人纷纷被烈焰吞噬，转瞬便灰飞烟灭。

    我应声道，旋即向刃尖注入寒冰的魔法，在剑刃灵巧的舞动中冰霜与寒风向着她周围的兽人席卷而来。随着一声声碎裂的轻响，遭遇冰火两重天的兽人冻结的肢体如同玻璃般裂成碎片。莱娜尼尔嘟起嘴，手中的火焰渐渐熄灭。“喂，别抢了我的乐子。”，她大喊道。旋即，随着传送魔法的波动，她的身形出现在兽人营地的另一侧，烈火与爆炸的硝烟也随之燃起。

    我大笑着转身，剑尖轻击地面，地震的烈波横贯开来，周围的兽人纷纷不支倒下，任凭利刃穿透他们的脖颈。紧接着，狂暴的闪电在剑锋聚集，如同投枪一般射出，发光的尾迹一路噼啪怒吼着撕裂兽人们密集的军列，在他们还没来得及反应之前取走他们的性命。斗志昂扬的我热血沸腾，脱下头盔和板甲，在敌人已经溃不成军的队列中尽情厮杀，享受击败敌人的快乐。斩月剑在血肉横飞的战场回旋舞动，战斗的声响如同精灵最欢快的舞曲一般。

    远处营地爆炸的烟雾和兽人的惨叫声点缀着莱娜尼尔的足迹，晴朗的夜空下烈火燃烧直冲云霄，如同焰火般绽放于空中。炽焰点缀着她的裙摆，她晶莹的眸子又比那烈火更加炽热，轻盈的舞步绽放着辉耀的光华，如同火灵的仙女下凡一般。此情此景，真是我一生所见最为美好最为震撼的那一刻。

    剩余的兽人试图召集起仅存的残兵败将准备撤退，然而我看穿了他们的胆怯，随着魔力的流动，一排惊涛骇浪席卷而来，将他们步步紧逼，只能退回莱娜尼尔由烈焰交织的包围圈。火墙的团团围绕之下，我的身躯如箭一般射入包围圈的中心，残余的兽人如同风卷残云一般成批倒下。轻踏于血泊之间，斩月剑与莱娜尼尔手中的烈火迅速终结了最后几个敌人。兽人部队被完全歼灭，地上只剩下超过四百具尸体。
 
    面对面地，我和莱娜尼尔的身躯矗立在硝烟弥漫的战场上，在肾上腺素的作用下，两个人急促的呼吸在空气中凝成雾气。“抱歉”，我气喘吁吁地说道，“我有些忘了，到底是谁杀的更多了…”。她害羞地微笑着，汗水从泛红的面颊滴落。战场的烈火和利刃撕开了她美丽的长袍，展现着长袍下雪白的皮肤。肩上的细带不知何时已经悄然滑落，营地篝火昏黄的光线照耀着她的身躯。混乱的呼吸声中，她的胸脯轻轻摇动，深邃的眼神饱含着柔情。
 
    她大步向前与我相拥，双唇热切地贴合在一起，嘴畔传来的柔软的炽热触感与战斗时烈火般的激情交织在一起，轻轻厮磨贴合我的下唇。浅浅地一开后，我再次与她深深相吻，舌尖游移舔舐，双手轻柔地在她的腰际环抱。她不顾一切地将我的脱了一半的护甲解开扔在地上，而我轻轻拉动了她长裙的腰系，摇曳的火光中，两人纯洁的胴体被繁星的光辉所点缀。寒冷的夜空之下，我们长久地缠绵在一起，皮肤微微渗出汗水，心脏的跳动比战斗之时更为强烈，妩媚的娇声如风吹动的烛火般摇曳。]],

    “为什么你不准备成为精灵们的领袖呢？”，莱娜尼尔悠闲地躺在我的床上，双手撑着头饶有兴致地问道。

    我的思绪还没有从片刻前的温存中缓过来，对于这个突然的问题感到有些惊异。“为什么我会想要成为他们的领袖呢？”，我反问道。

    “当然了，因为你的实力是那么的强啊”，她回答道，“我觉得你是你同族中战斗能力最强的一位，这样强大的力量足以让你成为他们的领袖。”

    我微笑道，“光靠武力是无法引领族人的。一个优秀的领袖需要用于承担责任，审慎做出决定，并具有灵活的政治手腕。我对于这方面的事情可没有什么兴趣，毕竟，伊菲尼亚斯陛下在这方面比我擅长多了。只要给我一把剑，让我能够和部下一起驰骋沙场，我就已经心满意足了，让真正的领袖来思考我和我的战士应该与谁作战吧。”

    她沉默半晌，看上去对我的回答并不满意，“呐，不过呢，你看起来对目前的计划并不满意。”

    这一令人惊讶的提问让我感到一阵震惊，我不知道她究竟是如何瞬间洞悉了我的内心想法。在此之前，我从来没有在任何人面前表现出过我的担忧，然而她一下子就看穿了我的伪装。她和我五个星期前才刚刚见面，然而任何事情都逃脱不了她敏锐的洞察。

    关于魔法大爆炸计划的筹备工作正在有条不紊地进行当中。卡库罗尔首领特塞尔已经返回了他位于北方的城堡，然而他的两个女儿仍然作为双方合作的大使留在这里，为我们在魔法技术上提供指导。这意味着莱娜尼尔和我可以时常相见，然而我们始终保守秘密。我高傲的同族们仍然难以接受精灵与人类的浪漫关系，而我们也无法接受可能迎来的流言蜚语。即使这样，我也难以抵御她的魅力，而她也是一样。

    “我是一个战士，”许久的沉思后，我从床上爬起，整理我的长袍，“我喜欢面对面与我的敌人作战，而不是一个人呆在后方玩弄考古这样的小把戏。这种懦夫一般的行为真是另一个真正的战士作呕。”

    “然而，开发夏·图尔人遗迹中失落的力量不是那么让人心潮澎湃吗？”她呢喃着，手指轻触下唇，光滑的皮肤置身于柔软的被子的紧紧环绕中，仿佛已经被她那恢弘的梦想深深吸引，“这样强大的能量已经在世间沉眠了那么长时间，直到今天，我们强大的魔法可以让我们亲自驾驭它们，把雷霆万钧的恢弘气势掌握在不及盈寸的掌心之中……唉，要是我能亲自进行这一伟大的冒险，那该多好！”

    搭上上衣的搭扣，我有些遗憾地摇了摇头。“坦率地说，我并不信任这些遗迹的力量。是的，我们永恒精灵的确有着强大的魔法实力。然而，我们渺小的知识比起那些夏·图尔人实在是相距甚远，以至于我们甚至无法理解他们所遗留下来的物件究竟有什么意义。在这一意义上，我的想法更接近你的姐姐尼耶拉。我们应该用稳健的脚步前行，妥善而审慎地使用那些我们所能掌握的能力，而不是猛然把我们的野心扩展到这种庞大的实验之上。”

    莱娜尼尔凝望着我，用调笑一般的语调柔声说道，“如果你成为了领袖，你可能会阻止这一切；但那样的话，或许我会一辈子恨你。”

    我露出了浅浅的微笑。“嘛，那还真是一件可怕而又危险的事情。”当我更衣完成时，莱娜尼尔仍然在床上休息，眉间若有所思。“我必须要前去检查关于远古传送门最后的准备工序了。如果你乐意的话，请务必和我一同前去。”

    她有些倦怠地摇了摇头。“不，我想要再休息一下。还有，看着他们欢欣雀跃、功成名就的样子只会让我嫉妒不已。请让给我在这里呆一会儿吧——我稍后就会秘密离开。”

    我小心地关上卧房的房门，一股阴霾仍然在脑海之中萦绕。随着时间的推进，魔法大爆炸的庞大计划也一天天被提上日程，一股不详的预感涌上心头。命运总是那么残酷，与计划进行的有条不紊相伴的是兽人战线上的节节败退，只有少数几个种族能够防守他们的边境线，而兽人们的进攻却永不停歇，愈演愈烈。他们的数量似乎无穷无尽，永不枯竭。尽管他们的战术十分简单幼稚，对待无力自卫的平民他们却能屡战屡胜，并在人马疲倦之时偷袭守备不力的城市得手。一周前，刚刚有一个人类王国在他们频繁的攻击下不堪其扰，最终溃败。他们曾经高傲地拒绝有关魔法大爆炸的计划，现在却只能跑来祈求我们的保护。看起来，对于兽人的侵袭这一迫在眉睫的危险，魔法大爆炸可能会成为我们唯一的希望。

    我从卧房顺着宫殿向前，混乱的思绪在我的脑海中盘旋，伴随着我漫步过庭院走向大门。眼前红发少年轻盈的身影让我误以为莱娜尼尔已经跟着我一路走来，然而她金色的长袍和明亮的眼睛让我想起了，那是她的姐姐尼耶拉。

    “在想着什么人吗？”，她微笑地望着我，观察着刚刚表情细微的变化。

    “抱歉，我刚才正在思考一些问题，”我轻轻弯腰对她示意。“我正准备前去督导和远古传送门有关的工作事宜，如果您——”

    “我想和您一同前去。”还没等我说完，她就爽快地回应道。我点了点头，领着她坐上我的马车。

    马车缓缓前行，尼耶拉的声音突然从我耳边传来。“她这样做只会伤害你。”

    我一下子明白了她的意思，感到一阵震惊。“要命，在埃亚尔已经不存在秘密了吗？”我小声说道

    “没有什么能瞒的住自己的姐姐，而且是双胞胎姐姐。”她温柔地微笑着，然而眼神却没有一丝开玩笑的气息。“我的意思就是这样，我爱我的妹妹，但我知道她的行事风格。她的情绪善变而无常，只愿关注于自己喜欢的事情。如果她一时感到厌倦，请不要因此而过分难过，想一些开心的事情吧。”

    “我想，我应该有能力整理自己的心情。”我抿嘴说道。

    她凝望着我的眼神慢慢移开，遥望着窗外变幻不定的风景。“唉，我想我已经提醒了你…”她柔声回答道，声音中仿佛包含着一阵忧伤。

    是她对研究的羡慕和嫉妒引发了争吵吗？还是因为她姐姐或者我的原因？我始终没有想到原因。剩余的旅途中，我和尼耶拉始终保持沉默。夕阳从马车的背后缓缓落下，巨大的阴影投射在向前的小路上，暮色的笼罩将周围的风景染上了一片深红。有一瞬间，我们仿佛在恶魔的位面上漫步，漆黑的阴影慢慢融化在血色的土壤之上，群星惨淡的冷白色光辉似乎瞬间从苍穹直射下来。繁星点点间，遗迹从地平线映入眼帘，让我不禁颤栗。

    考古学家们从来没有发现过比埃尔瓦拉附近的夏·图尔遗迹更为壮观的存在。我们的人民花了几个世纪来悉心研究它，调动的工程量庞大无匹深入地下，却又如此小心地不曾损坏和扰乱任何遗迹中的古物。这个遗迹的核心被称为水晶塔。从地面上向下看，我们只能看到巨大的方块，在泥土被清理之后显露出来是比大理石更加光滑的白色石板。继续往下挖掘，白色石板似乎无穷无尽，其表面也没有任何能够给出说明的雕刻和标记，直到半英里后我们找到了它的底部，没有地基那样的设施。这简直就像着整座塔并不是立于地面之上，而是在天空中漂浮，直到某种力量让它从空中坠落，静静地在大地中沉眠了无数的岁月。

    若干年前，我们的魔法师找到了遗迹上不可见的符文，终于叩开了遗迹的大门。遗迹内，壮观的水晶大厅以庄严而又优美的几何图案有规律的排布着，就连墙壁似乎也呼吸着能量。许多甬道和通路都只能通过飞行才能到达，而其顶端是一个足以容纳整个埃尔瓦拉宫殿的巨大房间。在它的中央是远古传送门，一个直径四十英尺的高台，巨大能量如同星云般在周围盘旋，噼啪作响。那是何等美丽而可畏，迷人而恐怖的壮观景象。永恒精灵们根本无法理解它工作的真正原理。即使通过小心的实验我们有办法操纵它所具有的能量，我们也永远无法真正知悉到底是什么力量驱动着它。

    寒冷的夜风之中，我和尼耶拉拾阶而上，笼罩于挖掘遗迹的阴影之下。我在白色方形石板构成的入口，我朝卫兵微微点头，尼耶拉的目光瞬间被欣悦所笼罩。这座闪光的大厅的确足够吸引眼球，但是里面空无一物的情景不禁令人感到孤单。我试着去构想许久之前，当这里仍然被夏·图尔人所充满的情景。“为什么夏·图尔人灭亡了呢？”漫步于水晶大厅，我轻声向尼耶拉问出了那个或许问过许多次的问题。

    尼耶拉听言微笑起来。“这当然是个谜啦！不过，我的母亲曾经告诉我，夏·图尔人在一场宏大的内战中走向了灭亡，他们所使用的魔法超乎我们任何人的想象。”

    “我也想知道。”我回答道。我们有自己的记录——当然，这些记录不曾与那些短命的种族相分享。不过不可否认的是，这些记录与传播了无数年的神话传说比起来，还是逊色了许多。

    我们到达了中央甬道。随着夏·图尔魔法的驱动，我们缓缓上升，眼前一层层废弃的屋室从上方进入我们的视线，然后缓缓地在视野中消失。卧房、工坊、储藏室、还有很多房间就连我们的博学之人也没法猜测出是用来干什么的。在经过几分钟的上升后，我们到达了远古传送门所在的大厅，尼耶拉不禁因惊讶而倒吸一口冷气。她的眼睛很快看到了夏·图尔的远古传送门，闪耀着映照着着几百英尺之上的天花板上的图案。在传送门的周围，一大群穿着丝绸长袍的永恒精灵正在紧张地工作中，而伊菲尼亚斯陛下正亲自指挥着他们。

    当他看到我们的到来时，他先行从一旁围绕的皇家顾问身边脱开身来，怀着自信的笑容向我们走来。尽管他穿着魔法研究院的灰色长袍，他的手中仍然拿着那把金色的法杖，辉光杖，作为他国王身份的证明。

    “啊！真高兴见到你，艾伦尼恩将军！”他说道，“你总是这么晚到。这位是卡库罗尔的大小姐吧，真是太好了。”

    我微微鞠躬。“是的，陛下。我在这里等待您的指示，为下一步的工作准备。”

    “啊，啊，当然是的，”他有些鄙夷地挥了挥手。“那么不用说，这位小姐一定是来这里确认我们到底会不会用魔法吧。”

    尼耶拉的微笑令人无法判断她到底是否是在生气。“能够亲眼见证你们有关遗迹能量的强大能力和丰富技巧将会是我无上的荣幸，伊菲尼亚斯大人。”

    国王微笑着点了点头，回身叫来了他的副官。“准备启动地形演示，火力全开。”他回身向我们说道。“我向你们展示的可不只是技巧和能力，而是从精微到庞大的一切细节。现在请你们稍等一下，我将会亲自完成这一切。”

    他与其他两名研究院高阶法师一起走到远古传送门面前，互相遥望，四周传来一阵阵和谐的低吟。随着法术的和声在大厅中飘扬，远古传送门周围的闪烁着星星点点的隐约红色。几分钟后，他们的低吟音调渐渐升高，变成了无比默契的轻声吟唱，然而始终保持在完美的协调之中。紧接着，他们高举手中的法杖，远古传送门中产了一束闪烁的橙色火焰。在它的悉心雕刻中，慢慢形成了一幅清晰的画卷，呈现出我和尼耶拉两人的图像。所有的特征都如此明晰，所有的动作都精巧符合，下至最小的细节都清晰可辨，简直如同站在一面巨大而澄澈的明镜之前。

    紧接着，随着吟唱的歌声越来越大，影像中的视野也愈发宽广，从中呈现出我们身边的远古传送门和周围围绕着的众多法师。视野飞腾而上，眼前所见的东西越来越小，最终化为宏伟大厅内的一个小点。紧接着，画面被一个白色的方形取代，周围是挖掘直入地底的痕迹，显然我们的视野正处于水晶塔的正上方。随着聚焦范围越来越大，大地奔腾而过，西部埃尔瓦拉市的房屋隐约可见。伴随着吟诵之声，我们看到了奔腾的大海，看到了西北的层峦叠嶂。我们看到了整片大陆的全景，北部寒风笼罩的高原被冰雪所覆盖，包围着的海洋似乎无穷无尽，大陆上闪烁着无数的白色小点，，如同繁星一般。咏唱达到了高潮，我们从宇宙俯瞰到了埃亚尔星球的全景，在火焰的缭绕中悬浮于半空之中，慢慢转动。

    然后咏唱停止了，先前的图像瞬间消失地无影无踪。我似乎听到尼耶拉因为刚才令人窒息的壮观景象而喘不过气来。

    “你现在看到了吗？”伊菲尼亚斯陛下大笑着。“我们可以全方位操纵这个远古传送门的所有能量，无论是最小的细节还是最大的范围，一切尽在掌握之中。还有，你看到地图上所标注的那些白点吗？这是世界上其他的远古传送门，而我们的这个传送门可以与它们中的任何一个链接。经过精心的操纵和悉心的控制，我们可以协调他们全部的能量，并用来实现我们的愿望。我想，你的那把剑可干不了这种事情，艾伦尼恩先生。”

    我仍然被我刚才所见到的奇景所震惊，无话可说，只能微微点头。尼耶拉似乎也产生了一样的想法，以和她的妹妹一样的热切眼神望着这座远古传送门。是的，她的想法被改变了。

    然而，我的手仍然环绕着斩月剑的剑柄，心头隐隐呢喃着不安之情。]],

#{bold}#第四章：黎明将至#{normal}#

    我骑着爱马在小道上前行，一旁并驾齐驱的是我的副手和手下的精英游骑兵与法师突击队。身旁一匹棕色马上，我的侍从高举一面画着被火焰环绕的剑的旗帜——那是我的随从部队的军旗。这个年轻精灵手中的旗杆似乎有些微微晃动，表现出他隐约的紧张之情。

    “孩子，把旗帜抓牢了！”我用命令的语调说道。

    侍从在马鞍上坐正，牢牢抓住手中的旗帜。“是，长官！”他大声回答道。“一切听你的命令，长官！”他的脸面朝前方，但是我似乎可以看到他的眼神仍然凝视着我，似乎正在急切等待着我下达指令。一切听我的命令…嗯哼，我以前也见到过这样的眼神，包含着一名年轻军人对长官的无限憧憬，当然可能还有一点超乎憧憬的东西。如果我没有莱娜尼尔的话，考虑一个这样帅气的小伙子似乎也不错。当然，现在显然并不是想这些的时候。

    今天就是魔法大爆炸计划进行的那一天了，那个孩子感到紧张是很正常的。计划的时间定在了子夜后的几个小时，我们的哨兵部队在其他种族的帮助下，已经将兽人的部队从大本营里引到了战场之上。我们的主力正集结成列，争取在计划实施之前拖住兽人的部队。在那里，排列整齐的长矛直指前方，刀剑和铠甲在繁星下闪光。一堆堆身穿紫袍的战斗法师站在阵后，高举长杖。那真是难得一见的奇景。当然，我们也知道，在不利地形下面对兽人全部主力的夹攻实在有着太大的风险。一旦魔法大爆炸计划无法执行，我们将会一败涂地。

    我在一旁的小丘上扎寨以确保对战场的全局把握，然后让我的随从前去联系北方卡库罗尔的支援军。当我骑着战马向哨所奔驰之时，隐约见到狼烟从东方升起，四条灰色的烟流在黎明前的光照笼罩下摇曳。那是被兽人们焚烧劫掠的村舍，他们刚刚被我们的佯攻部队所吸引前来这里。村子里的居民已经预先撤离，然而经此一役，他们已经注定无家可归。在这场横跨大陆的战事中，他们只是战争中渺小的牺牲品罢了。

    第五道烟尘从远方升起，在清晨绿色薄雾的笼罩下，这些烟柱如同伸展到世界各地的魔爪，正准备撕开地面，吞噬一切。这个恶魔就是兽人，它是对我们任何种族的威胁。无论付出什么代价来阻止他们都不过分。这就是我当时的想法，这就是我们所有人当时的想法。

    当我到达卡尔库尔的营地，莱娜尼尔亲自前来与我相见。她看到我时的笑容是如此温暖甜蜜，然而我知道更让他兴奋的是今天的大事。“再过几个小时”，她就像一个不耐心的小孩子一样悄悄说道，“有趣的事情就要发生了！”

    我走进卡尔库尔的营地，在里面看到了尼耶拉和其他高阶法师与来自人类诸王国的代表。我知道特塞尔不会亲自前来，因为他要和他的人民呆在一起。这并不是因为懦弱和衰老让她远离前线。实际上，据说自从他的爱妻被兽人所杀之后，他就再也没有参加过战斗，以防止他的仇恨夺去他的理智，让他在暴怒中杀死他的朋友。然而，众所周知，他有时会独自在北方的冻土上流浪，与震耳欲聋的狂暴飓风为伴。兽人们只要听到特塞尔，北之暴风的名字就会闻风丧胆。

    尼耶拉和莱娜尼尔指挥着卡库罗尔的部队，从那些大法师凝重的表情可以看出他们都很清楚接下来的一天会带来什么。然而，尼耶拉的眼神却包含着无尽的困扰之情。

    “你的姐姐怎么了？”我悄然问向莱娜尼尔。

    “一些无聊的梦而已。”她没好气地说道。

    尼耶拉的眼神突然激动起来。“这不是梦！”她大喊道。“我告诉你们，这是未来的预兆！”她转过头来，用哀求的眼神望着我。“你必须相信我，艾伦尼恩先生，今天一定会出大事的！我昨晚在梦中见到一幅恐怖的场景，仿佛它是许久之前的记忆一般。我看见一座座城市陷入燃烧，昔日大理石、玻璃和白银所铸瑰丽壮观的景象，现在只剩下断垣残壁。我看见无尽的火焰中是成千上万人在死亡降临之时撕心裂肺的呐喊，无论男女老少全都在劫难逃。我看到城市从空中缓缓崩塌坠落，昔日美丽的空中花园成为一片废墟，城市与大地上碰撞的重击将大地完全撕裂，天地为之变色。我看到剩余的城市仍然在一边互相发射毁灭性的紫色的光柱一边缓缓坠落，空气中弥漫着灼烧和杀戮的气味。哀嚎满地！尸横遍野！死亡枕藉！任何人都无法想象这样的人间地狱！”

    “我告诉你的并不仅仅是梦境！这是一条信息，一条警告——这是一段逝去的传说，因为我们根本不了解我们在把一场多么大的危险视同儿戏！计划必须被终止！”

    在尼耶拉慷慨激昂的怒吼声中，莱娜尼尔不耐烦地抖着脚，但是我看到许多其他的领袖看起来有些动摇。我知道为了计划的进行必须让她冷静下来，所以我向前走去，双手放在她的肩上，冷静地望着她的双眼，慢慢向她说道。

    “最好把这个梦忘掉吧。你知道，世界上没有一天不处在危险之中，而今天则是比任何时代的任何传奇中的日子都要重要的一天。我们的文明正处在危险之中，我们的生活方式正遭受兽人们野蛮侵袭的威胁。我们的命运宛如悬于刀尖之上，我们的和平生活正摇摇欲坠，任何错误的决断都会让我们跌入黑暗和绝望的深渊。今天，我们将会做出最大的决断。所以你说的对，你收到了一个消息，你受到了一条警告。而我们所应该做的，就是回应这个警告，就是变得足够坚强。今天，我们要紧握希望的缰绳，我们要扼住命运的咽喉，只有这双真正坚实的双手才能引领我们逃离袭来的毁灭，才能给我们带来真正的和平。尼耶拉小姐，你能成为我们坚实的双手吗？”

    她用开朗和充满希望的目光望着我，手指紧握住我的手腕，仿佛要从我的身上汲取力量。她慢慢地点了点头。“对不起，艾伦尼恩阁下。我只是……我会变得坚强的。”

    我转向那些被我的演说所感动的人。显然，如果放着他们不管只会带来麻烦，我必须让他们立即开始行动。“现在开始！”我大喊道。“集结你们的军队，为这场世纪之战做好准备。我们经过坚实和审慎的努力取得了计划的进展；我们会用精锐的部队抵挡他们的侵袭；最终，在烈火和愤怒之中，我们将会取得胜利，重获自由。今天，将会永载史册！今天，将会给所有种族带来新的纪元！魔法大爆炸，将会成为所有人被铭记的一天！”

    被刚才的命令所鼓舞，所有人欢呼着冲向前去，组织起他们的部队。尼耶拉回身组织其她手下的法师，而我独自离开了帐篷。一出门，我就撞见了莱娜尼尔，她一边和我嬉戏一边大笑着，连拉带推把我带进了一旁的空帐篷里。

    “你说过你不准备成为领袖的！”她笑着说道。“你刚才的演说真是比我见到的任何领袖更加优秀。”

    我耸了耸肩，谦虚地笑道。“我只是说了一些我该说的话。”

    她的语调变得低沉，一瞬间的忧虑从她的脸上涌过。“这只是个梦，对吧？”在她平日幽默的语调中，隐约可以觉察到她极度恐惧的心情。她的手指稍稍颤抖，仿佛在渴望着我的保证。

    “这只是一个梦而已，”我撒了一个小小的谎，却不知道，这个谎言的代价即使用我的一生也无法赔付。“一切都会好起来的。”我亲昵地拉住她，轻轻拥抱住她纤弱的身躯，她用力抱紧我，还在微微颤抖之中。

    “谢谢你，艾伦尼恩。”她悄然说道。她转过头，与我长吻。这是我和她所经历的最柔软，最细腻的一个吻，也是我和她的最后一个吻。

    我们就此别过，我独自一人策马回到部队的中心。我的心脏如同震耳欲聋的战鼓锤响一般怦怦直跳，尼耶拉的言语依然在我的心头回荡。她的话语激起了一个我曾经经历过的梦境，这个梦境已经在我的记忆中沉睡了许久。在梦中，我躺在床上，在上方漂浮着一团光与空气的形状，仿佛某种我从来未曾见过的生物。他用长长的触手来代替四肢，鼓动的长袍在他的身上飘扬。它没有头和眼睛，但是我可以清晰地感觉到它正凝视着我。它向我伸出了它长长的触手四肢，如同试图抵挡一个黑暗而恐怖的威胁。我突然感到一股可怕的预感，似乎隐约可以察觉到，一场这个世界从未经历的巨大灾难即将来临。当触手的尖端触及我的眉间之时，视野一片漆黑。

    这只是一个梦吗？还是某种未来的预兆？或者这是一个真正的幽灵，想要直接对我发出警告？然而，当时的我没有时间思考这些。魔法大爆炸的时刻即将到来，现在已经没有怀疑的余地了。我策马扬鞭，命运的车轮滚滚转动。]],

I loosened Mooncutter in its sheath as the troops marched forwards.  My grip tightened on the reins, holding my horse in check lest it gallop ahead in the excitement, and I could see my squire to my left doing the same.  The tension in the air was palpable.  Before us, less than a mile away, the vanguard of the orcish armies was now visible.  We had stirred up their nest and they had responded in full force.  They were like a shadowy blight that swallowed up the horizon, a great pestilence that threatened to consume the world.  Before me the armies of the Shaloren seemed small in comparison, but I knew our strength was not told by mere numbers.

Trumpets blared from the bulwarks at the front, as they readied to engage with the first wave when needed.  To the north were archers to crumble the initial resistance, and at their flank a legion of spellriders, their hands glowing with arcane energies as they sat atop their fearsome steeds.  On the south was the regular cavalry, the greatswords, the armoured knights and the main bulk of our mages, readying support spells.  Here and there senior battlemages were dotted about, ready to move swiftly to points of intense activity and blast it away.  There was no need to have more than one of them in any place - alone they could decimate a score of orcs with ease.

Drums beat loudly in the distance, and a clamour arose from the enemy.  They had with them trained beasts and trolls, and were arrayed in swords and maces and crude armours.  One took up a loud howl and others joined in, and the air seemed to reverberate with their ugly voices.

The cacophony was unsettling, but my army responded with a display of power.  Swords and speartips rose into the air, and crackles of lightning shot up to the heavens, the sparks shining off the gleaming blades and armour.  The orcish army gasped in dismay.  The eastern skyline was beginning to glow red, and we knew the dawn would break any moment now, the signal for the start of the Great Spellblaze.

“The day is here!” one of our warriors shouted out, and it was taken up elsewhere by the marching troops.  “The day is here!” they began to chant, anticipating the glory to come.  “The day is here!” my squire sang, his voice full of youthful joy and hope.  “The day is here!” we all shouted in unison, the pride of the Shaloren kingdom in our hearts as we watched the first rays of sunlight shine out from the horizon.  “The day is here!  The day is here!  The day is-”

Silence.  All at once our voices dropped, and a terrible brooding silence swept over the battlefield.  We could feel it, every one of us, so attuned are our race to the flows of magic.  It was like having the breath sucked from one’s lungs, or the earth disappear from beneath one’s feet.  All our mana channels were gone, changed suddenly, arcane energies beyond all reach.  Groans and murmurs began to arise, as mages clutched at their heads in sudden despair.  I saw my squire lurch forwards in his saddle and begin to vomit uncontrollably, my standard slipping from his hand, whilst others fell to the ground in pain.  I struggled to battle an overwhelming migraine, blotches appearing in front of my eyes, and with great effort of will I managed to keep control of myself and began to seek out new paths of mana.

But there was something wrong, terribly wrong.  Like a river run off its course the flow of magic across the whole of Eyal had changed.  What could have caused this?  And now I had to fight years of attunement and training that had taught me to naturally rely on the known flows and courses so that I might find new paths, new sources.  And as I did so I put my powers into divination, and what I discovered shocked me to my core.

The orcs saw us in disarray and began to charge.  But my attention was turned west, not east, towards Elvala and the Crystal Tower where our leaders had been manipulating the Sher’Tul farportal.  But the tower, I felt, was gone - crumpled into the earth, and from there now emanated a wave of white-hot flame.  The orcs tore into our army with little resistance, their weapons tearing through the elven troops, but they were soon met by a wave of destructive energy far greater.

“Shields!” I shouted out as the whole sky turned redder than blood, but above the sudden deafening roar of roasting air I was not heard.  It would have helped little anyway, defenceless as my army was without their usual sources of mana.  Spears of flame streaked down on our heads, shearing through flesh and steel in an instant and sinking into the earth.  The ground shook, and lava blasted up from the deep holes torn into the rock.

I put an arcane shield about myself with a great effort of will.  I saw my squire raise a hand to do the same, but a blaze tore off his arm.  He didn’t even get to scream before another wave burned through the top half of his torso.  Spurting blood evaporated instantly, and the air became full of red mist and fire.  I leapt from my horse as it neighed and stumbled and fell burning into ash.

Another wave came, and I tried to strengthen my shield, but the force of it took me off my feet and sent me flying.  I was thrashed through the air like a swirling leaf, unable to do anything more than struggle to maintain my protection.  All about my army was being utterly decimated, ranks and ranks of soldiers and mages burnt to a crisp or torn apart by the raw energies.  The orcs were the same, and a huge rent in the ground swallowed great numbers of their troops.  Blasts of lava soon thundered upward and rained down for miles around, turning into glowing rivers of death that swept across the consumed landscape.

How I managed to stay alive I am still not sure.  I almost slipped from consciousness at several points, but by a mental tenacity I never knew I had I managed to stay focused and keep my protective shield active.  I became less aware of my surroundings, not knowing if the bubble of my ward was floating through air or fire or blood, or swallowed into the depths of Eyal into some hell never before witnessed.  At last, after what seemed like a tortuous age, the wave of energy passed, and I found myself lying alone on an outcrop of cracked and parched earth, the air a haze of heat about me.

I struggled to my feet and looked around, seeing nothing but desolation in all directions.  Steam and smoke rose from rents in the ground, and blood, limbs and ashes were strewn about all over.  Nothing was alive.  In a daze I despaired that I was alone of the hundreds of thousands who had stood here but a short while before.  Friends and comrades, mentors and students, people I had never known and ones I was dearly close to - all gone.  A sudden pain lanced my heart as I thought of Linaniil.  She could not be dead, surely?

I gritted my teeth and summoned the energy to levitate, and as I rose I began to get my bearings around the changed landscape.  Slowly I pushed north-east, passing over devastation beyond belief.  I struggled to keep a grip on my sanity as the scent of burnt flesh and blood surrounded me, my vision filled with a horrored landscape beyond imagination, the utter silence more deafening than any sound I had ever heard.  Eventually I came near to where the Kar’Krul army had stood, and cast about the ruined land for some sign of life.  Then faintly I detected something, some small sliver of life, and searching it out I found her.

Her clothes had been mostly burned off, her hair half turned to ash, and blood was seeping freely from burns all across her body.  A weak shield still hummed over her, but as I knelt down and laid a hand on her it vanished.  Quietly she gasped a breath before whispering, “Neira”, and sinking into unconsciousness.  She was still alive, but barely.  I looked about and saw no signs of her sister, or of any of the rest of her troops, other than the scorched flesh and blackened bones that marked the scourging path swept by the blaze.

I began to cast what healing spells I could on Linaniil, but I could tell it was not enough, and my weakened powers could not hope to save her.  I began to cry openly, thinking of all I had lost this day, all that had gone so terribly wrong.  Hope had turned to crisis, and the cruelty of fate was far too much for me to bear.  Cradling my dying love’s head in my lap I turned my face to the sky and screamed.  Torment was in my cracked voice, and I raged against all the injustice of life and the futility of war, surrounded on all sides by blood and bones and ashes.  They had once been souls and lives with hopes and dreams, now all cast away like dust in the wind, and I lamented their deaths and my despair.

But mine was just one voice, one torment, a single note in the great cacophony that spread across the continent.  Millions of lives lost and shattered, millions of voices raised in anguish and torture and suffering, as the devastation continued over all Maj’Eyal from the ultimate force of destruction, the Spellblaze.]],

Perhaps what happened will never be truly understood.  What Sher’Tul ruins survived the Spellblaze have been little touched since - the burned hand learns its lesson.  But we know that Ephinias and his mages lost control somehow, whatever delicacy and balance they wrought with coming untangled.  At the moment they tried to connect to the other farportals the imbalance was reverberated, resonated, magnified beyond control.  The farportal in the Crystal Tower imploded in a fraction of a second, killing all within and crushing the land about.  The energies in the Sher’Tul relics then erupted in a blaze of white light, turning the air to fire and the ground to ruin.  The blaze swept eastwards, rolling over our battle with an unstoppable destructive force, and then carrying on towards the Thaloren lands.  Most of the ancient forests of Shatur were ripped from their roots, and the lands lain cursed ever since.

Meanwhile the other farportals all over Maj’Eyal erupted, white stone cracking and vast swathes of energy spilling forth.  All of the Cornac lands to the west were turned to desert, the dwarven halls of Korhek crumpled, the midvale plains were risen up as mountains and Lake Nur formed in their wake.  In the south the ancient tower of Darafel was collapsed, and the forests beside it morphed into an ever-broiling scar of lava and blackened earth.  Far in the east the Naloren farportal, the largest of all in Maj’Eyal, disappeared in a vast earthquake that swallowed everything for miles around, and boiling water spewed up to fill its cavernous depths.

And whilst this destruction was wrought the incredible energies disrupted all of the mana flow around Eyal.  Streams of energy that followed set, slowly changing courses, now were flooded and droughted, warped and split.  The threads of the elements were in vast disarray, and any attuned to magic suddenly found themselves far away from their accustomed power sources.

Even the Heavens were changed.  The wandering star of Vor disappeared, the constellations were tilted off their normal course, and the seasons rent harsher since.  Some say the moons dimmed and the sun went whiter after that day.  I do not know.  The whole world has seemed darker to me.

The numbers killed are beyond count.  The initial destruction took at least five million lives, and the terror that followed claimed far more.  For though it had been a day of tragedy and immeasurable woe, it was to be followed by a bloody age of darkness and torment.

But none of this I knew as I lay weeping in the aftermath, cradling in my lap the one life I cared about.  In abject misery I called on all the healing powers I could to bring her back to me for but one moment.  Her heart beat softly, and her eyes opened, but seemed glassy and far away.

“Linaniil,” I whispered, and her dark eyes turned towards my face.  I tried to mumble an apology, to say I was sorry and was unable to help her, but emotions overcame my voice.  Her gaze at me was empty, as if she looked right through me, before she turned her eyes away.  Slowly she raised a hand to an amulet about her neck, and with a light touch it glowed and then cracked.  Her eyes closed again but I could feel the power from the artifact pumping into her, strengthening her heart-beat and mending her flesh.  She was unconscious and still badly wounded, but for now the mortal threat was gone.

My thoughts were mixed - glad she was no longer at death’s door, but worried she might relapse, and at the back of my mind scared of that empty look she had given me.  Could she possibly forgive my part in this?

Carefully I picked up her frail body, and began the journey back to Elvala.  Two days it took on foot, through blasted and ruined ground.  On the passage I came across other survivors, refugees now leaving their destroyed homes, heading to the city to seek shelter.  I tried to nurse Linaniil as best I could, giving her water during brief periods of waking and dressing her wounds, but true healing could not happen till I reached the city.

Elvala was a quiet chaos, oppressed by fear and uncertainty, an air of dread filling all the streets.  The news had broken that our army had been entirely wiped out - there would be no loved ones returning to their families, and the sound of stifled mourning was to be heard in all corners of the city.

I took Linaniil straight to the healing grounds in the palace and gave her to the doctors with the strictest instructions.  They were swamped by casualties, but followed my orders without question, tending immediately to her wounds and applying tinctures and regenerative spells.

It was as I watched over her quietly that a party bustled loudly into the grounds.  I recognised at their head was Perissa, a senior court official.  At her side was an elderly human who immediately went to where Linaniil lay.

“General Aranion!” announced Perissa loudly, “I heard you were here, but I could scarce believe it.  Thank the threads you have returned to us!  This is a grave time; we must talk at once.”

But I ignored her as I saw the human touch Linaniil’s hand, and her eyes gently open.  “Cuilan?” she murmured softly.

“Aye, it is me, my lady,” he said quietly.  “I have been sent here by your father.  He has ordered me to pass you this.”  And with that he brought forth a golden ring set with a fiery ruby.  I recognised it immediately as the Ring of Kar’Krul, worn by the mighty Turthel.  Linaniil sat up quickly, wincing from the pain, but with her eyes locked on the ring as it was placed in her hand.

“But mine father...”

“I’m sorry, my lady.  It brings me great sorrow to bear you this news.  Your father and his court are dead.  His last act was to instruct me to bring this ring to you and your sister.  Neira...” he said glancing about.  “Is she...?”  He saw the look in Linaniil’s eyes and dipped his head despondently.  “I see.  I am terribly sorry.  It becomes my duty then, my lady, to declare you the new leader of the Kar’Krul.”

“General Aranion,” interjected Perissa.  “I really must speak with you now!”

“Wait!” I barked, and turned to the human Cuilan.  “What is happening here?  How could one such as Turthel be killed?”

The man looked at me then with a wan sadness in his eyes, before turning to address Linaniil.  “Yesterday, the day after the terrible Spellblaze, as we began some attempt at reconstruction, still struggling to realign our mana paths, a murmur began amongst the people.  It spoke thus: The Kar’Krul circle of mages had betrayed the ordinary people.  They accused us of siding with the elves to destroy non-mages, of toying with terrible powers beyond our control, of deliberately massacring them out of evil and malice.  We could not logic with them, they would listen to no reason, and they rose up in violent anger.  They attacked many of us, with farming instruments and whatever weapons they could find.  Our defences were weak, and striking back just made the crowd fiercer.  We retreated to your father’s home, begging for help, but he shook his head and said he could not fight back.  They came for us then, storming his palace, and Turthel ordered all to put up no resistance.  He handed me his ring, saying to seek you out in Elvala, and then stepped outside to face the crowds.  He didn’t resist!  The people... they... they...”  He lapsed into sullen silence, shaking his head in sorrow.  He looked like he wanted to cry, but had no tears left to shed.  Linaniil’s face was graven and she stared hard at the ring.

Perissa grabbed me then and turned me to her attention.  “This is what I need to speak with you about, General Aranion.  If this human’s tale is to be believed then we are in very grave danger!  Scout reports suggest there is a body of humans coming here from the north as we speak.  From what this human says they seek retribution - they wish to slaughter us all.  A storm of wrath lies on our borders and we are defenseless!  We need you desperately to organise our defence, to protect our city and our people.”

I felt numb, the events overwhelming me.  “But who leads us?” I said.

“There is no one.  What royals are known to be alive are not suited.  We are entering a time of war, a terrible time like no other we have ever faced.  We need military leadership.  You, General Aranion, you must be our leader.”

I held Perissa’s gaze then and saw the wisdom in her words.  My duty as a Shaloren was clear.  But my heart tremored as I turned to look at Linaniil.

“This be our path then, Aranion,” she said quietly, raising herself from the bed and carefully placing the ring on the middle finger of her right hand.  “I must tend to mine people, and ye to yours.  We will not meet again.”

“But your wounds-” I tried to object.

“Will never heal!” she cried, hate dripping from her voice.  Her eyes were like cold and impenetrable ice, a smouldering anger deep within.  “Come, Cuilan, we must leave this place.”  And with that they departed, Linaniil walking tall and proud in spite of her injuries.

I closed off my heart and my emotions then, lest they overwhelm me.  My duty was before me, and the events of the past had to be locked away from memory.

The ceremony was organised in under an hour, and I was anointed leader of the Grand Council of Elvala, head of the Shaloren people.  On my order rangers began transporting in survivors from outpost settlements, whilst I commanded our remaining mages to begin a new endeavour around our city walls.

The first waves of the storm of hate came the next day.  Human peasants and farmers, ordinary workers armed poorly, their looted swords and spears badly wielded.  I stood alone at our gates as they approached, Mooncutter in my hand.  When the first few charged at me I thrust the blade into the soil and tore a great chasm in the earth, and our mages summoned forth mists and smoke that rose from the ground and began to surround our whole city.  As the peasants stumbled in confusion archers started firing from our walls.  What few made it through the smoke and arrows I took on, tearing Mooncutter through their flesh with little resistance.  Their blood gushed out in the gallons, drenching our ground, staining my skin.  It was like a warm shower over my boiling emotions, a bath of blood to wash over my sins.

The Shroud of Elvala was begun, as our whole city was wreathed in cloud and smoke.  Our shield, our mask, our hiding.  It would last for centuries, the only dealings with the outside world being in furtive secrecy.

We veiled our guilt, cloaked our crimes.  Though we had some communication with the outside through halfling traders and the odd disguised Shaloren adventurer, we remained mute to the world at large, hidden from their accusing gaze.  Outside our quiet walls others had not the luxury of hiding.  The Spellhunt was begun, and it knew no mercy.

Ordinary people rose up against what they perceived as the arrogance of the mages, a revolt against the power of the few that had ruined the lives of so many.  Any suspected of sorcery or ties to the Art were cruelly dealt with.  There was sympathy for none, and many innocents fell victim to the unquenchable thirst for retribution.  The madness swept across the whole of Maj’Eyal.

Law and order had broken down.  Armies, territories and whole cities had been destroyed or ravaged by the Spellblaze, with many areas left completely uninhabitable.  Kingdoms fell and tyrants arose.  Bandits picked at the bones of civilisation like vultures on a rotten corpse.

An organisation called the Ziguranth, thought dead long ago, came into resurgence, gaining popular support from the people in their anti-magic crusade.  We heard of some mages going into hiding, but inevitably being rooted out, or fleeing desperately from place to place.  Dark tales also arose of necromancers and fell wizards creating dungeons and strongholds, fending off or evading attacks, and beginning reigns of terror.

And one tale came to my ears of a group of mages that managed to band together and stay in hiding, though always on the run from the chasing Ziguranth.  The story from outside was that they were led by a demon with fiery hair, fiercely glowing eyes and hands wrapped in flames, that fought with blazing wrath and could be opposed by none.  I knew that description well...

I carried out my reign, my duty, taking care of the Shaloren people.  We were safe from attackers, secure in our supplies through discrete trade, and slowly building back some of what we had lost.  But both fear and shame prevented us from showing our face to the world.

Fifteen long years passed before I awoke one night in my council chambers, the crescent Wintertide moon softly illuminating a shape near the end of my bed.  The figure was tall and slim, wrapped in tight-fitting wools and furs.  Her crimson hair stirred gently as she stood with her back to me.  Memories arose of a night long ago, in a more innocent time, when a younger me and a younger her first became close.

I barely dared to whisper her name, afraid that she might disappear, an apparition or a dream that could be broken by a spoken word.  “Linaniil,” I softly mouthed.  She turned to me, and I saw those same dark eyes I remembered.  But they were surrounded by lines of care, the markings of years of strain and responsibility clear on her face.

Rising from my bed I gathered a robe about me.  I took a few steps towards her but stopped, not able to move myself any further.  I wanted to be near her, to put my arms around her, but it felt as if she were across a wide chasm from me, a gulf of time and pain between us.

“I have come for help, Aranion,” she said in a low voice, not quite meeting my gaze.  “There be something I seek, and ye must aid me in achieving it.”  I did not understand, but I nodded my assent.  “Get ye dressed and ready then.  There be a long journey ahead of us.”

She stepped towards the window, her back towards me again, waiting as I put on a stralite mail and gathered my sword.  When she noticed I was ready she levitated out, and I followed.

We whistled through the air, travelling northwards at great speed.  The lands swept beneath us, and the climate grew colder as we went further and further north.  Hours passed in intrepid silence, till we were flying above snowy tundra.  We soared past plains of white and grey before we reached a low range of hills.  Here Linaniil slowed and descended, and I went down beside her.  We came to rest before a dark opening at the foot of the hills.

Linaniil stood for a while staring at the black cave.  Fear radiated from her face, but her eyes were hard and determined.  “It is here,” she said quietly, her voice steady.  I followed her gaze, trying to guess what secrets this remote place contained, but I could sense nothing special.

She marched forwards and I followed, until we came right up to the shadowed opening.  Linaniil hesitated a moment, staring into the blackness, before finally stepping inside and being swallowed from sight.  I could feel it then, the sensation that something ancient lay in this place.  My skin tingled and my arcane attunement felt on fire.  This dark cave held some mysterious force, secluded from all knowledge since the oldest days of Eyal.  There was something here that could change the destiny of the world.

I took a deep breath and stepped forwards.]],

Light sprung from Linaniil’s staff, and she cast about a luminescence, revealing a narrow icy passageway that led downwards.  It was deathly cold, and our breaths condensed in clouds as we made our way down the wending tunnels.  My skin pricked, and all my senses seemed on edge.

“What is down here?” I asked, my curiosity all-consuming.

“Power,” Linaniil responded, not looking at me as she spake, continuing to follow the path.  “And power be what I seek.  I am afeared for mine people, but have not the strength to protect them as I wouldst like.  With what be here, perhaps, I shall have the power to make a safe haven.  This be a place of legend amongst mine people, and I have scouted it out over many years.  Today I shall finally reach what lies at the centre.”

“And why do you need me?”

She didn’t respond, but carried onwards.  We reached a split in the tunnel, and without hesitation Linaniil took the left path.  It led further and further underground.  We came to blockages, but by arcane force the sorceress easily cleared a way.

As we passed through a large cavern I sensed movement, and drew Mooncutter quickly.  What looked like a disembodied limb, or some great thrashing worm, was writhing towards us pathetically.  Linaniil send a blast of fire towards it - it squealed and went still.

And then more movement, a hundred movements.  From crevasses and holes in the walls and ceiling there burst out dozens upon dozens of the worm-like creatures, their maggoty bodies flapping rigorously, fanged mouths opening up and screaming torturous sounds.  Linaniil growled and began sending torrents of flame towards the approaching horde.  I covered her back, slicing open their pale green flesh and sending strokes of lightning through their ranks.  In under a minute we had dispatched them all.

I prodded a corpse with my foot and it collapsed into sludge.  “What strange creatures,” I commented.  I looked at Linaniil for some explanation but she simply proceeded forward.  I followed after, keeping my sword in hand and watching closely for further attacks.

At the other end of the cavern a wall of ice blocked our way.  Linaniil held up the Ring of Kar’Krul, and the jewel on it began to blaze.  The ice melted away slowly, revealing a passage to another, smaller chamber.

This cold, crypt-like hollow was covered in smooth, glistening ice on all sides.  The walls were square and straight, and ancient pillars of marble were dotted about the room.  On the pillars and walls were weathered runes and symbols.  I came close to study some, but couldn’t recognise them from any of my studies.  “What was this place?” I asked, turning to Linaniil.  “It seems older even than Sher’Tul.”

She ran her hand over one of the walls, tracing the outline of a door.  “It be a temple to Quekorja, god of a race called the Weissi.  The were killed off by the Sher’Tul long before our races were born.  They did build this temple in honour of Quekorja, and the last of them did die here defending her.”

I looked about in awe.  Though I had explored many Sher’Tul ruins I hadn’t seen anything like this.  The architecture was simple but elegant.  There was a crude beauty to it all.  I turned back to the door Linaniil was examining.

She was trying to open it, but was obviously struggling to find a way.  “There be some key, some puzzle to open this,” she muttered.  “But I can nay solve it - the secret be lost to time.”  She growled in anger and stood back.  Holding out her staff she unleashed a blast of arcane force from it, violently splitting the stone door apart and tearing open a passage to a chamber beyond.

Many things suddenly happened at once.  From beyond I felt a pulse of energy, a huge surge of power that I had never felt before.  Linaniil was focussed on it intensely.  But noise came from all around of creatures moving asudden.  From the cave we had entered from there was a shriek of a hundred wailing voices, and the floor beneath our feet trembled.  Rocks fell from the ceiling and out burst horrific creatures with spiked limbs and smooth, triangular faces.  From the trembling ground arose a strange ethereal being of light, with long tentacles for limbs.  And as I turned to face these threats I saw that in the previous cavern the worms had come back to life, and were now coalescing into a huge mass of putrid flesh.

I tried to cut through the being of light, but my sword barely slowed as it passed through it, and the flames I summoned seemed to have little effect.  It raised a tentacle towards me and an intensely bright beam of light shone from it through my torso, filling my flesh with searing pain.  I jumped back and send a wave of ice at it, tearing off a tentacle and pushing it further away.  Meanwhile Linaniil had reduced one of the spiked creatures to a pile of ash, but her arcane shield was collapsing beneath the slashes of the others, and more were spilling from the ceiling.  In the entranceway the mass of worms was pressing through, and from the mouths of the flailing bodies came spits of burning acid.

We were at severe risk of getting surrounded in this confined space, the numbers too many to take on at once.  “Over here!” shouted Linaniil, as she dashed through the door she had split apart.  I followed, slashing my blade through the mass of worms, causing it to lurch back screeching in pain, and spearing a blast of lightning through one of the spiked creatures, splitting open its head.  It continued to attack me, but I parried and cut its arm off, dancing around it and reaching the doorway.  With my back to the opening I brought up a wall of water and sent it flooding into the chamber, pushing the horrors away as I leapt backwards through the door.

As soon as I passed through Linaniil thrust her staff into the ground and a pillar of rock rose upwards, sealing off the opening.  I could hear thrashing and thumping sounds from the other side, but for now we seemed safe.  “What were those things?!” I asked incredulously, as I scanned around the open cavern for signs of any more creatures.  It was a large space, but everything was still, and I could see no other entrances.

“Scions of Amakthel,” she responded calmly.  “The butchered god seeks to break his chains.  But he needs more power...  And here in this dark, forgotten place is part of that power he seeks.”

“And what is here?  What terrible power lies here that would draw both you and those horrors?!”

“Quekorja,” she said.

“Quekorja?  The... the god?”  I couldn’t believe I what I was hearing.  “Was it not slain by the Sher’Tul?”

“Aye, that it were.  But there be power even in a slain god.  Look behind ye, Aranion.”

I turned then, wondering what she wanted me to behold.  It took me a moment to see it, but when I did I gasped in shock.  The far wall of this great cavern was not merely a wall.  It was covered in a thick layer of ice, but beneath at its centre I could make out a huge yellow eye.  And around that eye I could trace out a giant form.  Dark grey skin covered a bulging head, topped with three great curved horns, which sat atop a long, thick body with six limbs.  It was deathly still and chillingly ancient, seeming more like part of the rock than anything that had once been alive.  I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, but I could feel it.  In that corpse was still power, immense power, like nothing I had ever felt before.

“This be it,” said Linaniil.  “One of the few corpses of the gods left to find in Maj’Eyal.  And I shall take its power as mine own.”

“This is insane!” I shouted.  “You have no idea if that is safe or not.  You don’t know what it will do to you!”

She chuckled darkly.  “Aye, that be true.  But that is why I have brought ye here.”  I looked at her in confusion and she chuckled again.  “Ye still know not your purpose here.  Did ye think I took ye here for protection?  That I couldst not handle those horrors on mine own?  No, there be a different reason I have brought ye.  When I absorb this corpse, when I take its power for mine own, I do not know what wilst become of me.  It may kill me.  Or it may drive me mad, it may turn me into something terrible.  Should that happen, Aranion, you art the only one I know with the strength to kill me.”

The words hit me like a blow to the chest.  “Kill you?  But I couldn’t...”

“But ye must!” she said firmly.  “After all ye have done... all the torture ye have brought my life... ye owe me this.”  I looked deep into her eyes and saw the turmoil of emotions within, the pain and agony of all that had befallen her, the hatred and blame of those who had wronged her, the guilt and shame for not being able to do more herself.  And deep inside still some touch of love for me and what we had shared.  I reached out my hand and stroked her soft hair, my fingers touching lightly against the side of her face.  I leaned in close and she closed her eyes, turning her face up to me as I moved my lips towards hers.

“No!” she suddenly cried, pushing me back.  “It cannot be!”  She swiftly turned from me, and I saw a tear drip down one cheek.  “The world has changed, Aranion.  I have a duty before me, and none can walk that path beside me.”  And with that she began to run, staff in hand, towards the great eye whose dead gaze was locked behind the wall of ice.  I sprinted after her, but she was faster, and with running leap she thrust the base of her staff through the ice and into the center of the god’s eye.

The ice cracked with a deafening thunder, and the giant yellow eye pulsed before exploding in a ball of light.  I stopped and covered my eyes as white light flooded the room and shards of ice flew through the air.  I could barely make out Linaniil, bathed in light, hanging with one hand from her staff, her hair and robes blown backwards as she reached forwards with her other arm.  Slowly, intrepidly, she placed her hand into the centre of the ball of light where the eye had been, and shadows danced about the cavern as she wrapped her fingers round that luminous sphere, before squeezing tight.

The cavern shook, her staff shattered, the wall creaked and split before wholly blasting apart.  The corpse of the dead god collapsed into a stream of silver and in a roaring cacophony rushed towards Linaniil, tearing apart her robes and sinking into her skin.  She floated in the air, limbs outstretched as the vast energy poured into her flesh.  She opened her mouth as if to scream and light burst out, and light spilled from her eyes and ears.  The cavern quaked dangerously and rocks fell from the walls and ceiling.  But in seconds it was over, the corpse of the god fully absorbed, the light in Linaniil’s eyes went out, and she dropped to the ground like a stone.

Then the horrors broke through, the collapsing cavern having made an opening for them, and immediately they sped hungrily to where Linaniil lay.  “No!” I cried, rushing to intercept them.  “You cannot have her!”

I sliced off the head of a spiked creature and put up a wall of fire ahead of the rest of them as I backed towards Linaniil’s body.  She looked dead, with no sign of movement or breathing, but I had no time to check.  The being of light and tentacles passed through my flames without resistance, and I ran sparks along my sword as I tore it up the centre of the monster.  It shot light through my torso and I coughed up blood, but I forced my sword in deeper and ran a flood of arcane energy through it, blowing the thing apart.  More spiked creatures came, and I took care of my footing whilst parrying and chopping on my left and sending waves of flame to my right.

The mass of worms broke through the wall, and with it two more luminous horrors, and some fiend of darkness and nightmares, and I could see behind others were spilling through.  I put up a shield as rays of light shot towards me, and sent balls of frost back at them.  One of the light beings fell, whilst the other was slowed.  The dark thing came quickly, and the mass of worms not far behind, so I sliced my sword across the ground, sending heat through it, and turned the stone into a mass of lava.  The dark thing came around it, and I felt an aura of deathly cold from it as it approached.  I hacked at it desperately, and it shot back speared limbs towards my chest that seemed to suck all strength from me.  With a roar I shot a pulse of flames down my blade and it burst apart.  The worms charged directly over the lava, squealing in pain as a bulk of them were burned, but coming at me with speed.  I adjusted my grip, getting ready to make deft strokes to stay out of its range, but a lance of light then shot through my leg, dropping me to one knee with a scream.  The mass of worms rushed at me then, and I dug my sword deep into their midst, but the worms crawled over my arms, digging their acidic teeth into my flesh and reaching for my neck.  With my left arm I cast a blanket of flames over them, burning my arm along with the screeching worms.  They pulled away slightly, but the being of light was approaching from the side, a tentacle flaring up in luminescent energy, and three spiked horrors were behind it.  My right arm was burnt, my left leg injured, my mail pocked with holes, and my mana reserves were running low.  But I gritted my teeth in determination - I could not back from this fight.  I rushed at the mass of worms with my sword held firm.

It exploded in a fiery mess, and an intense wave of force and fire blasted across the cavern, turning the other horrors to ash, and even burning through the luminous being - a low scream arising from it as the flames tore it apart.  I gasped, not knowing whence this blaze had come, until I turned around and saw Linaniil.  She was standing tall, her robes burnt off, flames dancing up and down her skin, bright light shining from her eyes.  Heat seemed to radiate from her.  I kept my grip on my sword, not sure if this was the Linaniil I knew, or some other force born of her union with the dead god.

She laughed suddenly, and it was a harsh laugh that I had not heard her make before.  “What a fool I have been,” she said, almost to herself.  “I brought ye here in case ye had to stop me.  But now...  Now mine power exceeds ye by a long distance.  Ye would have no hope of opposing me!”  She made a low sound somewhere between a laugh and a sigh.  “Ah, but ye have no cause to worry.  I am still me.  Mostly.  And through pain and sacrifice I have achieved the power I desired.  The power I need.”

I let my sword dip and breathed heavily, relief mingled with trepidation sweeping through me, whilst the withdrawing adrenalin of battle left me feeling exhausted.  I looked Linaniil over, her pale skin now glowing, her eyes brimming with energy and vitality.  I saw the power she had was not in mere force, but that she had taken on the ageless nature of the gods.  A power forbidden to all creatures was now hers and hers alone.

“What now?” I said quietly.

“Now, ye go home, and I go to make mine home, a sanctuary for me and mine people.”

“Will we meet again?”

She smiled sadly.  “Mayhaps.  Mayhaps not.  The world changes quicker than predictions can tell.  But if we do meet again it shall be in a place that does not yet exist - the city of Angolwen.”  She raised an arm then and from it shot a tremendous pulse of arcane energy, the violet light shooting to the roof of the cavern and spearing through, deep through, till it split the rock apart right through to the open sky a mile above.  Sunlight spilled down, splashing over Linaniil’s lithe form.  It had been many hours since this long long night had begun.

“But for now, farewell Aranion,” she said as she began to float from the ground.  And then she sped up and soared out of sight.

I lay down on the cold stone, resting for a while, slowly healing my wounds and recovering my strength.  I reflected on the events since the evening before, thinking back on the trials of all the races of Maj’Eyal.  War, disease and death threatened all equally.  Was Linaniil beyond that now?  How would a taste of immortality affect her?

It was then that thought for our race came to me.  In ages past we had searched for immortality.  Our ancestral leaders had obsessed over it, but out of vanity, pride and a fear of death.  What would the real effects be if all our society were to be gifted with it?  With immortal life we might separate ourselves from the strifes and wars of the world.  It would give us a perspective beyond the petty squabbles and prideful competition of the other races.

I dug through the ice and rocks and found still some trace of the dead god Quekorja, faint though it were.  I gathered all that was left and made the long journey back to Elvala.  There I retreated to my labs, studying the remains for years before finally unlocking its secrets.  It was thus that immortality for our race was born, and it has changed our outlook on the world ever since.

We stood apart from the others then, not engaging in war, finding a new respect for life.  It was not till Garkul the Devourer assaulted our gates in the Age of Pyre that we ever had cause for large scale war again, and I rode out to face him in combat.

But ah, that is another tale, one indeed of many tales, in the long and rich history of the Tales of Maj’Eyal...]],
