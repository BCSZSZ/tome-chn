我们最初发现克洛什卡时，里面住满了恐魔。我们杀戮了他们，并试图修复这里奇怪的奥术机械。遗憾的是，它损坏严重，我们只能将其部分修复，但仅仅是它所具有的这一小部分力量，也足以给我们带来安宁。之后，更多流浪者追随着我们来到了这里，以在充满敌意的地下寻求一处避难所。他们当中有在别处无处容身的智慧生物、有寻求着禁忌知识的先知，还有目睹了太多凡人的目光所不能承受之物的人。

之后我们便开始学习。我们领悟了世界的秘密，潜入了地表居民看都不敢看，恐惧着被其中的东西凝望的无尽深渊。我们并没有这种恐惧，因为我们正是在其中凝视着他们的那些存在。 在这些地方，我们找到了许多真相，发现了能够改变埃亚尔历史进程的禁忌魔法。

我们会在这片黑暗之中等待着时机，将这里变成一座知识的灯塔。如果这个世界不给我们容身之处，我们就自己去夺取它。当时机正确之时，我们就将让地表知道我们的存在，告诉他们，我们并不只是一群被他们当做害虫一样轻轻扫开的，毫无心智的乌合之众。]],

	lore = [[Gods are beings which have been frequently mentioned throughout Eyal's history. They are a foreign concept to most readers, since most Eyalites of the current age have not encountered them. The word god gives you the impression of some almighty and obscenely powerful being, which these beings most certainly are. But, there has been little scholarly work dedicated to defining what exactly a god is. Multiple cultures across Eyal's history all have varying descriptions of the gods, despite the same names frequently appearing among them. 

As a scholar of 克洛什卡, I spent much time wandering the surface of Eyal and learning from the surface races regarding the gods, including many famous places of learning such as Anglowen. It was a hard sell, but I even managed to [i]convince[/i] an imp to retrieve certain documentation on Urk'Rok as well. This series of documents has been written to catalogue information regarding the gods and to develop as accurate a picture of them as myth and history will allow and this preface is to give a general impression of what exactly a god is supposed to be.

There have been many powerful beings who have walked across the surface of Eyal. Being a god isn't simply a question of power, however, despite the enormous strength of these beings. What separates gods from other beings is their ability to reverse entropy. For future reference, we shall refer to this power as antropy. This power also allows them to reshape reality to their own whims and desires. Some gods made their own races, others merely altered beings living on Eyal, playing with their evolution and changing them in unfathomable ways. While some might attribute this behaviour to some greater purpose, there is more than enough evidence to suggest that the gods are fallible and motivated by things just as petty as we mere mortals. In my scholarly opinion, we were simply created for their amusement.

While this might drive some to despair and make them believe that mortal will is pointless, it is noted in ancient myth that the gods were slaughtered by the Sher'tul and driven away from our world. Whether or not their absence can be considered a good thing, it cannot be said. There are some surviving stories of the gods' blatant cruelty and complete disregard for the races they made as they squabbled among each other, wrecking great scars across the surface of this world. It is also noteworthy that the gods, despite their impressive power, were not always intelligent beings. Some were believed to be barely sapient, or even sentient. One theory about this is that the gods were primitive beings living on Eyal's surface and just so happened to be infused with antropic energies, artifically elevating them above other primitive lifeforms.

With these things established, we will discuss the gods of Eyal and what influence their actions had, and continue to have, on our world. While I discovered many gods in my studies, it is entirely possible that Eyal had even more gods than what is documented in my findings, but their existence cannot be substantiated by existing scholarly texts.]],

It was said that it was the creator of the Sher'Tul, that ancient and mysterious race whose true nature is still unknown to this day. More than any other god, Amakthel appears as a creation figure in ancient myths, more readily interfering with mortal beings than any other god. Nearly every race has some myth of Amakthel coming into contact with them, some describing it as a glowing, divine being while others declared it as a bringer of ill omens. Its touch seemed to curse as readily as it blessed according to these different sources, altering beings in ways that only made sense to Amakthel itself. As such, it is difficult to get a clear picture of Amakthel's true personality and disposition towards mortals.

How exactly Amakthel's downfall came is not certain. Some myths say that the Sher'Thul were commanded by their creator to kill the gods, while others suggest that the Sher'Tul openly rebelled against them. ]],

	lore = [[Ralkur, the god of illusions and deceit, was perhaps the most petty god of Eyal. The myths of Ralkur are often tragedies, describing the downfall of its titular character after trusting a mysterious stranger. Due to the consistency of these stories, it can be concluded that Ralkur did not care for meddling with things on a large scale, but preferred a much smaller one. It delighted in understanding what drove mortal races and how it could bring a single person to ruin with nothing but words and clever lies. It always revealed itself at the end of the tale, its hapless victim realising that they had been fooled all along. In this sense, Ralkur was cruel in a way that was distinct from the other gods.

When the god slayer Branzir came for it, Ralkur came to know fear and fled. The chase between god and god slayer was the stuff of legend, and many myths tell of the great trials which Branzir overcame in his pursuit of Ralkur. In the last moments of the chase, Ralkur was spared and told to leave Eyal by Branzir. However, Ralkur later returned and struck a terrible blow against Branzir's homestead, slaying his family and his servants. The already driven Branzir became obsessed with Ralkur and chased it across the entirety of Eyal. Having nowhere else to run after stumbling into a dungeon, Ralkur chose to go down into Eyal's depths, creating layer upon layer of illusions, creatures and distractions to prevent the relentless Branzir from catching it. Since no one can enter this dungeon without leaving, it can only be guessed at how deep the dungeon has become. Some say it is even infinite and that the chase between hunter and hunted continues to this day.]],

It seemed to be a more curious god than others, as a handful of myths mention it making contact with mortals so it could learn more about how they lived. The myths surrounding Gerlyk are noticeably less numerous than those of other gods and there appears to be large time gaps between them, suggesting that Gerlyk simply did not interact with Eyalites for the most part. For this reason, it is seen to be a god who observed, but didn't interfere.

In particular, tales after the Godhunt tend to have a far less favourable outlook of the god than pre-Godhunt myths. Speculation regarding this is due to Quekorja supposedly taking an interest in written history and appointing its own librarians to record its tales. Since there are no surviving records of this library existing, this theory is considered to be pure conjecture and has no concrete evidence to validate it. There have been some unusual records found too, supposedly written by the same authors on the same dates, but wildly varying in their tone and their description of the god itself.

As such, it was attributed in many mythologies to the creation of numerous diseases and plagues. Some myths stated that there was necessity to Xadoch's presence, as its plagues prevented any one race dominating the world and kept a balance of sorts. On the other hand, many other myths attest that the god had a cruel curiosity. It spread blight across the world and created diseases just to see what sort of effect they would have on sapient life. If it weren't for the other gods on Eyal, it is believed that Xadoch would have scoured the entire world of sapient life.

Xadoch was one of the first gods to be felled in the God Hunt by the hunter Branzir. The Sher'tul had a particular dislike of the god, as it had tried to undermine them with plagues numerous times.

While most Eyalites of the current age think of trolls as dumb brutes, they have frequently proven themselves to be far more clever than they're given credit for. The most commonly attributed dominions of Ugg'matho were the forests and mountains of Eyal. In ancient texts, the title bestowed upon it was 'The Gardener,' for it deeply loved the forests and green places of Eyal. It is thought that it created the trolls in its own image, as savage and powerful stewards of the wild places.

In some legends, there are tales of it reaching down from the sky and annihilating settlements, for it saw civilisation as a blemish on the green canvas of Eyal's surface. In others, it instead chose to alter nature itself to stave off civilisation, creating various plants and guardians to prevent sapient races from plundering its forests for resources. The recurring theme of many of its myths is that it was vehemently opposed to sapient beings living out of harmony with nature.

Ugg'matho was frequently in conflict with other gods in its myths. Many a story tells of how the gods and their chosen champions went on great troll hunts in the wilderness, chasing down Ugg'matho's children in order to wipe them from the face of Eyal. While the tales often described their great success in ridding the wilderness of the troll menace, the sheer number of them throughout the ages suggests that they were not as successful as they made out. One myth stated that Ugg'matho eventually struck a deal with the other gods where they would leave its forests alone and it would leave their creations alone in return. Another states that Ugg'matho was made to submit by the other gods and begrudgingly continued to undermine them in secret.

When Ugg'matho was slained by Branzir, it is said that its blood took on a life of its own, spreading out into the wilderness in the form of living ooze.]],

The demons affectionately refer to him as their Father and they have nothing but praise to sing of him. Since there are not many different sources to cross reference, it may not be possible to get an unbiased examination of Urh'Rok's personality.

Their homeworld is described as a collection of fragmented continents held together only by Urh'Rok's will. According to the demons, this was the result of a great cataclysm which came through a Sher'Thul far portal. Their records state this cataclysm occurred roughly at the same time as the Spellblaze did on Eyal. This suggests that the Spellblaze had far reaching consequences beyond our current understanding and could have impacted multiple worlds.

Despite the benevolent and gentle demeanour he has been attributed in his myths, demons have frequently declared their atrocities committed against Eyalites in his name. This contrast in his attitude toward Eyalites and his own creations does not suggest a benevolent disposition, but rather one similar to a father protecting his spoiled children.

The Godhunt started because Amakthel commanded the Sher'tul to slay the other gods. Caldizar personally went out and audited potential candidates to wield the Godslayer weapons.
