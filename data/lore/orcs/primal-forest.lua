This forest is the site of a massive and ongoing ecological disaster.  As far as I can tell (and as a Mender, I have at least [i]some[/i] clue of what I'm talking about), Eyal's trying to fight off an infection, and the infection's fighting back for all it's worth.  Given the indiscriminate hostility of the local treants, we can assume the infection's winning, if only slightly; it's concentrated most of its power into a handful of crystalline avatars at the top of the great tree.  Best case scenario, Eyal's pushing them out like splinters, and destroying these avatars will eliminate the problem; worst case, the tree is already infected down to its roots, and these avatars are its spores, growing until they're ready to leave the tree and spread elsewhere.  I came to destroy these crystals myself, but I wasn't counting on the treants turning on me as well; since you're reading this, congratulations!  This is your responsibility now.

My advice?  Head through the portal to Shatur and call for backup.  I don't have that option, as that'd require incriminating myself by admitting that I was in Var'Eyal without a pass (you wouldn't judge me if you knew how much the trolls were paying for cheerblossom).  I can assure you that the others there are considerably more dedicated and competent than I am, even if only as a group; together, they'll be able to control this infection and treat the wounds it's left behind.  If you go in alone, you'll likely get ripped apart by the treants before you can even reach the trunk - and more are waking up every passing minute.  Unless you're the Hero of Maj'Eyal or Garkul's reanimated corpse, you'll be walking into your own grave.  Let the professionals handle this.

If you insist on going in, though, here's what I know:

-The treants, unfortunately, are no longer concerned with discerning friend from foe.  Anything not stemming from Nature is a potential source of the infection in their eyes, and must be purged before they can slumber once more.  I know that saying "please" isn't exactly sufficient for asking you not to defend yourself...  just try to keep the damage to a minimum, so they can heal the land once ravaged by this sickness.  If you want to avoid them, get off the ground level and into the canopy as soon as you can; they won't animate if they don't see anything on the forest floor to attack.  Also, do NOT try to take a core sample!  Trust me on this - as much as I wanted to know how deep the infection had spread, whether it was all the way through the tree or if it had pushed it all to the top, it attracted the treants to me like Shaloren to a stupid decision.  

-The destructive agent in question is a group of animated arcane crystals, of the type previously documented in the Scintillating Caverns.  The exact processes involved in their formation are still unclear, but it's a safe assumption that they're connected to the massive surge of blight introduced by the Spellblaze, and proof that even now, the damage is most likely worse than we can ever be sure of.  Expect to take powerful blasts of every kind of magic if you're not exceptionally evasive; fortunately, although they frequently teleport, they are completely immobile between blinks.  If one teleports near you, either take cover, or destroy it before it can reposition itself.

-The consequences of letting this go unchecked would be disastrous.  Even if this great tree's growth IS a sign of the planet successfully fighting the infection off by pushing it out, the crystalline avatars could simply climb down, bury themselves, and sicken Eyal once more.  And if Eyal's losing...  as much as I loathe to say it, perhaps those Shaloren pyromaniacs could do some good for once in their all-too-long lives, and cauterize the area down to the roots.  Provided, of course, that they can figure out how to do so without blowing up the sun.

I wish you luck, and thank you for doing what I cannot.  There are reasons why this is a risk I cannot afford to take, but it's probably best for both of us that you assume I'm a coward.  It's not too far from the truth.

With unending gratitude,
(This is where I would sign my name, were I an utter moron.)

PS: If you wouldn't mind doing me a personal favor, please destroy any written articles you find.  They spilled out of my bag as I fled; I'm already a coward, and I'd rather not be a litterer as well.]],

The damage left in the Scintillating Caverns, in Norgos' Lair, and in countless other places has only now become clear, after the Hero of Maj'Eyal made them safe to explore once more.  Now that peace has been brought to these lands, Eyal is beginning to heal - but with the arrival of our magic-using cousins from the East and the Allied Kingdoms' growing acceptance of magic, the balance may once more tip towards ruin - but YOUR help can keep Eyal healthy!  Join the Menders, and start helping the planet today!

LEARNING AND OBSERVING

Our founders, once Guardians of Shatur, have always known the importance of maintaining a balanced ecosystem.  Do your hobbies include birdwatching, exploring the wilderness, and taking in the sights of natural flora?  We can provide you with a list of animals, plants, and fungi of interest; simply go out and write down where you explored, when, and how many of these species you saw.  Our experienced naturalists can use this information to track migration patterns and monitor the spread or decline of those species, allowing us to take action if one becomes endangered or invasive; already, they're working to restore the balance disrupted by the Hero of Maj'Eyal's constant slaying of local wildlife.  Change is inherent to the natural order; our experts know to only step in if a change would drastically and destructively hurt the ecosystem.  Nature solves most of its problems on its own, but occasionally we may need to hold its hand (particularly in response to mutations caused by unchecked use of arcane magic).  If you'd like to learn more about the natural order, we have a diverse community of knowledgeable naturalists who are happy to answer questions or provide a more thorough education.

REPAIRING AND HEALING

Volunteers who prefer a more hands-on approach can expect to start making a difference right away, by joining our reclamation and decontamination efforts.  It's no secret that the Hero of Maj'Eyal's many battles took their unfortunate toll; many places are still littered with magic-contaminated objects or bodies, and in some places the ground itself has been polluted by the residual effects of these spells.  (This is, of course, to say nothing of the trees burned down, etc. by beasts and ne'er-do-wells trying to stop the Hero!)  You can help by destroying dangerously magical objects, planting trees, slaying ecologically-disruptive beasts (such as Norgos), and participating in cleansing rituals to speed up the healing process.

ABILITY, RESPONSIBILITY, AND ACCEPTANCE

The wilds of Eyal are a dangerous place; we do not expect our scholars to go into them defenseless!  For those who are already accustomed to use of the arcane, our partnership with the Living Fossils allows us to identify safe and responsible methods of using magic, and provide them with an introduction to the ways of Nature, and those who are already adept with Nature can always hone their skills with our veteran members.  If you have no ability with either, you're in luck!  We're eager to show you how to accept Nature's favors to defend yourself.  Anyone can learn to summon loyal beasts or channel wyrmic strength if they're willing to try!  These abilities can be used without giving up your attunement to the arcane, but you may find that you don't need your spells anymore, once you've seen how effective Nature's power is.  We will never force you to give up magic, but if you happen to be looking for a greater commitment, speak to your instructor about following the path of the oozemancer.

	name = "'On Tolerance'",
	lore = [[We recognize that times are changing.  Within a year, the Allied Kingdoms have gone from begrudgingly tolerating magic to openly embracing it, due to the influence of our rediscovered allies in the East.  Furthermore, if the reports are to be believed, the ecosystem of Var'Eyal remains healthy and intact, despite millennia of continuous magic-use.  Therefore, our views and approach must change with the times; we are not ignorant to new knowledge.

At this point, it should go without saying that reckless use of magic is a dire threat to...  everything, more or less.  Eyal has yet to fully recover from even the rampant necromancy of the Age of Dusk, let alone the Spellblaze itself.  Eliminating all use of magic is the only way to be safe from this situation repeating...  but it is possible that lesser uses of arcane magic do not have any inherent corrupting or harmful effect, judging from the Sun Paladins and Anorthil.  They have, contrary to our long-held beliefs, managed to use magic responsibly and safely.  We are not so blind as to deny that this is an incredible reassurance.  That said, this proves nothing about the most terrible potential of magic.  Maybe no Sun Paladin or Anorthil has yet sunk to the depths of depravity of the Age of Dusk sorcerers, or the tragically reckless mages responsible for the Spellblaze, but that is no indication that their magic does not have the potential for abuse.  

Fortunately, there is an alternative available!  With the proper respect, care, and concentration given to Nature, one can be rewarded with powers rivaling or besting the popular uses of magic.  On the civilian level, summoned fireflies can replace magical lighting, regeneration salves can replace healing spells, and accelerated crop growth makes for a far more nutritious diet than conjured foodstuffs.  For martial purposes, there's very little that can stand up to the powers of Nature.  An experienced disciple of Eyal can summon loyal beasts faster than any mage can blast them, crush spellswords of all types with draconic might, or dissolve a necromancer's army in a tide of corrosive ooze.  And if the disciple in question is familiar with the practices of the Ziguranth...  We do not condone their approach to defending nature, but their techniques speak for themselves when facing a hostile mage.  The best part about these abilities, though, is that they are self-limiting!  There is no potential for a runaway chain reaction, or a lone megalomaniac destroying much of Eyal.  The planet willingly gives us its power, and is conscious enough to take it away if we start abusing its gifts.  Even the most powerful of Wilders cannot abuse their power to the perverse degree that a necromancer can.

Thus, we're putting our efforts into two areas.  The first is advocacy of Natural alternatives to magic, talking to spellcasters to determine what they use magic for and figuring out ways to use Nature's abilities to do the same task just as well (if not moreso).  We've continued the Ziguranth efforts to make all-natural replacements for Ogric runes (we predict that life expectancy is now only reduced by 40% with our newest mixtures), developed fertilizing recipes that outperform arcane methods of producing food, created wells near desert settlements otherwise dependent on water magic, and developed so many other techniques and applications that make magic just as obsolete as it is hazardous.  The second is minimizing the harm done by the arcane, by educating spellcasters on the safe, responsible, and Nature-conscious use of magic.  Not every spellcaster is evil, and in fact, some may enrich the lives of those around them!  Runic magic is at least somewhat self-limiting, and we are working with the Living Fossils guild in hopes of developing a new type of magic, one inherently linked to and limited by Nature.  Their stone-wardens have maintained perfect harmony with Nature despite constant use of the arcane; if this is truly the way forward, then we shall welcome it with open arms.

Another vandalized poster.  Calling us traitors, collaborators, declaring themselves the True Ziguranth.  Fools, the lot of them.

When I established the Menders, it wasn't because I thought the arrival of a handful of magic-users who also happen to be decent people disproved anything taught in Zigur or my childhood in Shatur.  It wasn't because I suddenly forgot that anything derived from arcane magic, no matter whether or not it's wrapped up in some mumbo-jumbo about the heavens, carries the risk of mutating into something that could put the Spellblaze to shame.  It was because those maniacs had ignored the shifting political tides for so long that they found themselves sliding into irrelevance, then went and skipped directly over irrelevance into pariahdom with that foolhardy assassination attempt.  They can blame the Far East all they want, but that was only the last nail in the coffin, alongside widespread acceptance of runes and alchemists operating openly across the continent.

I can appreciate their dedication.  I can appreciate their frustration, and how seeing the world treating magic-use as normal would just make them want to get more violent - but the fact is, the raid on Zigur was a mercy kill, preventing the fanatics from making us look even worse in the public eye.  We are long past the point where intimidation can get us anywhere - so we need to try a new approach.  If reminding the world of the horrors of magic isn't working anymore, the Spellblaze and the Age of Dusk being too faded from public memory, then we need to remind them of the wonders of Nature instead, wonders they can see for themselves, today.  If the public won't believe that magic is evil, they can believe that Nature is better.  If we can't make magic taboo, we can make magic obsolete...  and all of this gathers support we'd otherwise lack, curious minds waiting to be taught the beauty of Nature and warned of the hazards of the arcane.

So maybe the old guard's been overrun with Thaloren, youths, and others who care a great deal more about loving nature than hating magic.  I don't see why this is a problem - making Nature stronger will make it more capable of resisting the damage magic may inflict.  We've allowed the idea of supporting Nature over magic to survive the Allied Kingdoms' treaty with the Gates of Morning, the raid on Zigur, and the attacks on Ziguranth patrols.  We've established ourselves as a selfless, charitable organization working for the good of all, a reputation that will grant us significantly more credibility than our previous public image of a band of crazed fanatics.

Perhaps most meaningfully of all, there are [i]far[/i] more Menders now than there were Ziguranth in the last century.  These allies will help us support Nature to an incredible degree, and we've started offering volunteer courses in classical anti-magic training, allowing them to further refine our techniques for dealing with rogue mages.  If and when arcane magic causes another catastrophe, these allies will rally behind us as we defend Nature from those who threaten it...  And, who knows, maybe we actually CAN teach mages to show a sane level of restraint without wiping them all out.  I'm keeping my eyes open for ways to make that happen, no matter how unlikely they may be.

In the meantime, paying off Stone Warden trainers and buying enough mindstars and herbal infusions for our initiates isn't cheap.  I'm not proud of what I'm doing to pay the bills, and am fully aware of what it'd do to the organization if someone saw me, but this is the fastest and easiest money I've ever made.  Ten minutes of concentration, a few hours to re-establish my equilibrium, and I can grow enough cheerblossom to cover our expenses for a week.]],
