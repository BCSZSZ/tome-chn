Our pride has never been held in high esteem by the others.  We were the backbone of Garkul's army, the supply-runners, the road-builders, the medics tending to the wounded - all roles that had to be done to support those who gloriously fought in the thick of battle...  Alas, all this meant is that the others only barely accepted our necessity, barely concealing their distaste for us "cowards" and "weaklings."  Garkul stood up for us whenever the opportunity arose, so their prejudices were a moot point until his defeat; unfortunately, once the Allied Kingdoms started pushing us back and attacking the fortified towns we'd built in Maj'Eyal, we took the blame for not making them strong enough to hold off all attackers.  "What good are they?"  Rak'shor once asked.  "Even when they're hiding behind us, they still can't make anything worthwhile!"  When it was revealed that our then-leader had held off the Allied Kingdoms at one of their strongholds to buy enough time for most of our Pride's women and children to retreat to Var'Eyal, by way of launching ancient Nargol golems into human ranks via trebuchet, the accusations of cowardice gave way to ones of selfishness and betrayal.  We kept quiet about them, hoping to change their minds when rebuilding Orcish towns in Var'Eyal, hoping that they would come to see reason when they had roofs over their heads and wells to drink from, courtesy of our Pride; it seemed to work for the time being.  We kept our distance from the others, building our own homes in a distant corner of the continent, and only sending small groups out to do minor repair and construction.  The walls we built were strong enough to keep the Sunwall forces from simply walking over them, and that seemed to be enough.

Alas, this acceptance would neither grow nor last.  One fateful night, Grand Architect Kruk came running back after a meeting with the other leaders of the Prides, saying we had to leave immediately, and that the women had to go first.  To this day, we are not entirely certain what drove her to such a panic...  she only told us that we would never want peace with the other Prides if we knew what we were running from, and that we may need that peace someday.  We swiftly built a bridge to the Clork Peninsula over the next few days, looking back over our shoulders towards the other Prides as we worked, and on the night the last Orc made it across, Kruk set it ablaze with burning arrows.  On the distant shore, we could only see the torches of those who we had narrowly escaped.

We barely had time to sigh in relief before a thunderous noise roared above us, and a bright light came down from the sky, lighting us up but leaving the surrounding land dark.  A curious sort of golem fell from it, made of springs and gears rather than runes and stone.  It spoke with a scratchy yet organic-sounding voice, asking what had happened and what had caused the lights and noises in the dead of night; we told it we had fled the mainland for our own safety, and that we were only looking for a place to exist.  Hooks descended from the whirring airship above, dragging the construct back up, and it left without another word.

We found a suitable home on the far side of the mountain range, shielded by the surrounding hills and yet fertile enough to sustain us.  Once we had settled in, the airships and constructs began visiting us more and more often, at first simply watching, then conversing with us and even helping us build homes.  It was not too long until one of the constructs' masters finally came to speak with us in person; he introduced himself as one of the Atmos, the Steam Giants we'd assumed for so long to be merely an ancient myth.  They were a strange people, and one we began to admire as we became fast friends.  Wise and reasoned yet valuing strength, neither overly arrogant nor overly timid...  a bit on the frivolous and eccentric side, but living for countless ages alone on a mountaintop would do that to anyone, we reasoned.  Likewise, they seemed to think of us as their rambunctious but gifted children, and when they began to teach us of their steam-pressure-driven machinery, they were impressed by how quickly we adapted to and improved on it.  They gave us guidance and wisdom, we gave them drive and innovation; we could have become true allies, if we'd only had enough time.

All good things must come to an end, it seems.  One day, a panicked scout ran into our camp and announced that an Orcish army had arrived by boat on the shores of the Clork Peninsula, and was charging toward us with hostile intent.  Whatever they had originally wanted that drove Grand Architect Kruk away, they were no longer content to go without it.

We told the Atmos, and they told us to simply reason with them; they had clearly never been under attack!  We would obtain no assistance from them, not even when our lives clearly depended on it.  Instead, Grand Architect Kruk showed us a series of schematics she'd made, ones that she dared not reveal before for fear of the Atmos seeing them - ones showing how to turn our helpful steam contraptions into hideously effective weaponry.  A harness to wear the great whirling lumber-saws as weapons, portable steam generators so we could power our machinery like the Atmos could without being tethered to a pipe or hose, a means of removing the safety mechanisms on nail-guns and swapping their barrels out so they could fire sling-bullets at incredible speeds, a giant version of the jewelry-plating device they gave us that could electrocute dozens of invaders at once...

We held strong when the other Prides came for us, and we were fighting with weapons they had never encountered before, inflicting wounds they had never learned to tolerate or heal, fighting with forces that they could not hope to even understand, let alone fight.  The shrieking din of sawblades shredding through armor and severing limbs, the screams of Gorbat's wyrm-riders as giant grappling hooks pulled them out of the sky, the smell of Orcish flesh cooked through to the core by lightning or scalded by jets of steam, the rattling of steamguns as they turned an attacking formation into a pile of corpses - these sensations might haunt the nightmares of Atmos and the other Prides, but to us they were the sweet sounds, sights, and smells of victory and safety.  We had prevailed, with only a handful dead on our side before they fled.  Kruk Pride would not be conquered.

The Atmos, however, did not see the dire circumstances we were in.  They did not see the threat we faced, and I doubt that even if the Grand Architect of the Pride had told them what she knew, they would have listened.  All they saw was their tools of creation being used to destroy, their beautiful inventions being used for something so monstrous, their darling clever "children" causing bloody carnage on a scale hundreds of times greater than they'd ever seen.  They denounced us, and those who had begun to mingle with us promptly retreated back to the mountains.  We were no longer welcome using their technology, and perhaps not even living near their mountains.

We will miss their company, their ancient wisdom, and their cautious kindness.  We will not miss their squeamish ignorance and pompous self-righteousness.]],
